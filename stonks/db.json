The European Commission, the guardian of EU rules, proposed late on Friday to activate a \u2018general escape clause\u2019 in the rules to respond to the pandemic, which has triggered lockdowns in most EU countries and the closure of Europe\u2019s borders. \u201cIt will allow Member States to undertake measures to deal adequately with the crisis, while departing from the budgetary requirements that would normally apply under the European fiscal framework,\u201d the Commission said. EU rules say that governments have to keep cutting their budget deficits until they reach balance or surplus, and have to reduce their public debt/GDP ratio every year until it is at or below 60% of GDP. Italy has been struggling to reduce its huge debt of 137% of GDP due to sluggish economic growth and additional spending to offset the effects of the epidemic would have normally drawn a rebuke by the Commision. \u201cThe Italian government will be able to put as much money into the economy as needed. Normal budget rules, debt rules for example, will not be applied at this stage,\u201d Commission head Ursula von der Leyen was quoted as telling Il Corriere della Sera paper.     Once the Commission proposal is formally accepted by EU finance ministers at their next meeting, government spending to fight the coronavirus will be excluded from Commission calculations of deficit and debt. EU finance ministers, who have ultimate control of EU rules that limit government borrowing, agreed on March 5 that the economic impact of the virus was an emergency and an event outside their control, meaning EU budget rules should not apply. They repeated that message on Monday, agreeing that the rules will not stand in the way of responding to the pandemic, which the Commission expects to cause a 1.0%-2.5% recession in Europe this year.

The ECB launched a 750-billion-euro emergency bond purchase scheme to try to stop a pandemic-induced financial rout from shredding the euro zone\u2019s economy and raising new concerns about the currency bloc\u2019s viability. The new purchases bring this year\u2019s planned purchases to 1.1 trillion euros. The new purchases alone are worth 6% of the euro area\u2019s GDP. Italy, whose borrowing costs have spiked in recent days, saw its two-year yield slump as much as 100 basis points at one point. It was last down 66 bps on the day at 0.79% IT2YT=RR, set for its biggest one-day fall since mid-2018 . Ten-year Italian bonds yields were down 45 bps to 1.85% IT10YT=RR, and set for their biggest daily drop since 2011. The risk premium on Italian bonds - the gap over safer German 10-year Bund yields - tightened almost 100 bps from Wednesday\u2019s close to around 169 bps before widening back to 200 bps. It was last heading for its biggest daily decline since June 2018.  \u201cIt\u2019s a larger bazooka than they may have needed if last Thursday hadn\u2019t panned out so bad,\u201d said Peter Chatwell, head of rates strategy at Mizuho. Southern European bonds took a hit after ECB President Christine Lagarde said last week it was not the ECB\u2019s job to \u201cclose\u201d spreads. A series of clarifications followed but did not calm the markets.  On Wednesday, Italian yields surged, with 10-year yields rising above 3%. Worries emerged over whether Italy\u2019s debt can be sustained, since the government, already heavily indebted, will need to spend large sums to deal with coronavirus. ECB purchases will also for the first time include debt from Greece, which had been shut out because of its junk ratings. Now, around 12 billion euros in Greek government debt will be eligible for the purchases, according to Greece\u2019s finance minister. Greek 10-year yields, which had shot up nearly 300 bps over the last two weeks, fell by nearly 190 bps to 2.06%, set for their best day since July 2015. GR10YT=RR The risk premium over German government bonds fell 176 bps to 220 bps, down from over one-year highs near 400 bps on Wednesday. Spanish and Portuguese 10-year bond yields slid over 30 bps each. The premium they pay above German bonds also fell the most since 2018 and Spain\u2019s fell back below 100 bps. DE10ES10=RR DE10PT10=RR     (Graphic: ECB to the rescue: bond spreads tighter, here)     Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yield, reversed early falls and was last trading 4 bps higher on the day at -0.20% DE10YT=RR. It touched a two-month high at -0.14%. That came as an official familiar with the plan said  Germany intends to declare an exception to the debt brake enshrined in the constitution during a meeting on Monday to finance fiscal stimulus measures in the fight against coronavirus. \u201cThe news that the German government plans to seek approval for unlimited borrowing would be consistent with higher yields even under normal circumstances,\u201d said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.  \u201cBut there is a lot of market dysfunction right now and forced selling of more illiquid bonds, peculiarities.\u201d     Meanwhile, German manufacturers recorded the biggest drop in business expectations in the 70-year history of industrial surveys.

Because of these measures, \u201cdelays and disruption at country borders have been observed for the delivery of certain agricultural and manufactured products, as well as packaging materials,\u201d said a statement signed by trade associations representing EU farmers, food traders and the European food and drink industry. They also warned of potential labour shortages in the food industry as the sector relies on workers moving across the bloc. To try to avoid shortages of essential goods, food and medicines, EU leaders endorsed a proposal from the European Commission, the EU executive, on Tuesday to establish fast-track lanes at their countries\u2019 frontiers, but they did not agree to keep internal borders open. The industry said that was not enough.  \u201cWe welcome the recent Commission guidelines on border management as a good first step. Despite these guidelines, however, we continue to face severe disruptions,\u201d they said. They urged EU countries and institutions to prepare contingency plans for possible shortages of workers. \u201cGiven that the agri-food supply chain is highly integrated and operating across borders, any blocks of supply and workers will inevitably disrupt business. Our ability to provide food for all will depend on the preservation of the EU Single Market,\u201d the statement said. It called for the launch of fast-track lanes at border crossings that many states have not yet properly established. \u201cWe will continue to try to ensure that these are established, functional and that we alleviate any issue that arises with regard to the distribution and transit of products, in particular with food products and medical products,\u201d a spokesman for the European Commission said on Thursday.

The measure comes after EU countries failed for weeks to find a seller of face masks and goggles after they launched a joint procurement for these items at the beginning of March. The new strategic reserve would be complementary to joint procurement efforts which are underway, the EU commissioner for crisis management Janez Lenarcic told a news conference.  It remains unclear when the needed equipment could be bought, given the current strain on manufacturers which are mostly based in China and other Asian countries. To help Europe cope with the most immediate needs, China has offered to send 2.2 million masks and 50,000 testing kits to the EU, the head of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday.  The stockpile will be funded almost entirely with EU money, with a small fraction being covered with national resources of EU states.  The Commission said it had 10 million euros ($10.7 million) already available to build the reserve, and could use another 40 million euros if EU governments and lawmakers backed the extra spending. The actual purchase of needed equipment would be carried out by one of the 27 EU states, which will also host the stockpile. Many states have already offered to set up the reserve in their territory, Lenarcic said, a predictable move after France, Germany and a few other EU states which produce personal protective gear temporarily restricted exports to other EU nations at the beginning of the crisis, fearing shortages at home. Among the gear that the EU intends to stockpile is reusable masks, vaccines, drugs, laboratory supplies and intensive care medical equipment such as breathing ventilators. Under separate joint procurement procedures, the EU is currently assessing offers for gloves and body protection equipment, and is also already seeking to buy ventilators and laboratory equipment, including testing kits. Joint procurements are meant to facilitate purchases, lower prices and avoid harmful competition among member states. Many are also trying to acquire protective gear on their own. Last week China sent face masks to Italy, the European country worst-hit by the virus.

Mounting stress means she may have to do exactly that.  Wednesday\u2019s manic selloff showed as never before that strong words and action are required from the European Central Bank, beyond its offer last week of a temporary 120-billion addition to its asset purchase program to counter the coronavirus-linked damage to the bloc\u2019s economy.  Spreads \u2014 the gap between bond yields of a member state and benchmark issuer Germany, a gauge of the risk premium states with weaker credit metrics have to pay to borrow \u2014 have ballooned in recent days.

He said the ECB needed to tell markets how exactly it would deploy the additional 120 billion euros and especially whether it would skew bond buys to those members facing stress, or overlook the constraints imposed by its own rules for now. \u201cWe need to know details. They could boost the number, they could issue a statement that there is no technical or legal obstacle to increase QE (quantitative easing),\u201d he said, a reference to rules allowing the ECB to hold only third of each country\u2019s bonds. It is nearing that limit in markets such as Germany.  But more ECB action may not of course fix the issue \u2014 aggressive rate cuts and far greater bond-buying by the U.S. Federal Reserve haven\u2019t calmed sentiment. U.S. stocks have continued to fall sharply. Still, pressure on the ECB is mounting in tandem with  Italy\u2019s 10-year bond yield spread over Germany. That blew out to 320 basis points on Wednesday, before tightening after reports the Bank of Italy was buying Italian paper to restore order in markets. DE10IT10=RR.  Also shoring up sentiment was a report that euro zone officials are considering how to deploy the unused firepower of the bloc\u2019s bailout fund to limit the economic damage, via a scheme that could pave the way for more ECB purchases of Italian bonds. Still, Italy\u2019s bond spread over Germany is around 70 bps wider than it was a week ago.  The Spanish/German 10-year bond spread, close to its widest since 2016 DE10ES10=RR, is 50 bps wider. And the Portuguese/German spread, at around 160 bps, is near its widest since May 2018 DE10PT10=RR.  That relentless widening reduces the efficacy of ECB monetary policy, analysts said. ECB asset purchases so far have been key to holding down government borrowing costs and keep bond spreads over benchmark issuer Germany tight. Marchel Alexandrovich, European financial economist at Jefferies, urged the ECB to quantify what they would buy. Speculation the program will be skewed towards corporate debt may have contributed to the government bond selloff. \u201cWe get some weekly numbers on public sector purchases but a week is a long time in a crisis like this, they need to tell us what they are buying on a day and show us what flexibility they are using on the capital key to support markets that are struggling.\u201d ECB government bond purchases are done in sync with each euro member country\u2019s shareholding in the bank, known as the capital key.  But it has been flexible with this before \u2014 and policymakers have stressed that after Lagarde\u2019s comment last week that it was not the ECB\u2019s job to \u201cclose\u201d spreads. Financial conditions have materially changed since the ECB\u2019s meeting last week and further steps may be necessary to prop up the economy, Finnish central bank chief Olli Rehn said Wednesday.       \u201cWe expect the ECB to step up its QE, ISIN (bond issuer)limits and even more deviations from capital key, with a total envelope of at least 500 billion when the BTP-Bund spread hits 350-400 bps, which we expect in coming days,\u201d said Piet Haines Christiansen, chief strategist at Danske Bank.

Italy is battling Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of coronavirus, which is spreading across the continent, including the 19 countries that use the euro.   The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) bailout fund was created at the height of last decade\u2019s sovereign debt crisis to be a lender of last resort to governments cut off from markets. It has 410 billion euros of unused lending capacity. No euro zone government, including highly indebted Italy, is even close to losing market access, but some politicians believe that getting the ESM involved would reassure investors and help stabilize volatile government bond markets. The brainstorming is tough because of established divisions between fiscally strict and less frugal euro zone countries and because the ESM does not have any instruments designed specifically for emergencies like the pandemic. Two officials said an idea being considered is for all euro zone governments to apply for a stand-by credit line from the ESM to show markets they have serious money, if needed, to finance the challenge to their health systems and support crumbling economic growth. A joint application would also remove the stigma for a single country, like Italy, of asking for help.  Italy\u2019s very high and rising debt makes it ineligible for a Precautionary Conditioned Credit Line from the ESM, officials said, meaning that countries would have to ask for an      Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL). But the tougher conditions attached to the latter could make it politically less palatable for governments including Rome. An ECCL scenario could allow the European Central Bank could step in with its Outright Monetary Transactions program of unlimited sovereign bond buying, provided the ESM committed to buying government bonds on the primary market. ESM funds could be distributed on the basis of the ECB\u2019s capital key, which would give Italy, the euro zone\u2019s third-largest economy, a very sizeable chunk of the money. \u201cIn my mind, an ECCL would work for Italy,\u201d one senior euro zone official privy to the discussions said.   To make the conditions attached to the ECCL easier to swallow, they could be focused on the specific challenges posed by the coronavirus, rather than encompass a general overhaul of the economy. \u201cIf they insist on tax money from other countries without any conditions, that is in the end their responsibility,\u201d the official said.

The promise came after a five-hour videoconference as the European Commission forecast the effects of the pandemic would turn the previously expected 1.4% European Union economic growth this year into a 1% recession or worse, as whole sectors of the economy are put out of operation. \u201cFinance ministers are often posed very hard choices, but seldom on matters of life and death,\u201d the chairman of the ministers, Mario Centeno, told a televised news conference.  \u201cWe will protect our citizens and our currency come what may and with everything we have got. Our commitment to provide support in this time of need will be unlimited,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe will do whatever it takes and more to restore confidence and support a rapid recovery. Whatever further coordinated and decisive policies are needed, we stand ready to make them,\u201d he said. Asked by the ministers, the European Commission estimated that euro zone fiscal support to the economy announced so far amounted to about 1% of gross domestic product, or 120 billion euros ($134 billion), for 2020. The euro zone has also already committed at least 10% of its GDP, or some 1.2 trillion euros, in public guarantee schemes and deferred tax payments to help companies that could go bankrupt because of the epidemic and workers who could be laid off as a result of the slowdown.  \u201cThese figures could be much larger going forward,\u201d the ministers said in a joint statement. In addition, the ministers pledged to make full use of increased state spending for various welfare benefits deployed during economic downturns, or what the EU calls automatic stabilizers. Centeno said EU budget rules - the Stability and Growth Pact - which normally put limits on government spending and borrowing to safeguard the euro, would be suspended for now. \u201cThe Stability and Growth Pact will not stand in the way of our fight of this disease and its economic consequences,\u201d he said. The epidemic puts the EU economy in uncharted waters because it has already led to lockdowns in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Denmark, the Czech Republic, and Poland, and caused curbs on businesses and the movement of people in many countries. The ministers said that each country would decide individually how they would provide liquidity support for firms facing severe disruption and liquidity shortages in severely affected sectors. Transport and tourism have virtually ground to a halt because of the pandemic. Support could encompass tax measures, public guarantees to help companies to borrow, export guarantees, and waiving of delay penalties in public procurement contracts. Workers facing the loss of jobs or income would get short-term work support, extension of sick pay and unemployment benefits, and deferral of income tax payments. Individual state moves so far have included Germany promising half a trillion euros in guarantees for its business - and more if needed. France has promised support for French companies and Italy will allocate 25 billion euros to Italian firms and families.  Separately, the European Commission proposed last Friday a 37-billion euro investment initiative        The European Investment Bank, owned by the EU governments, would provide almost 40 billion euros to help firms stay afloat and the euro zone would explore ways to use its bailout fund ESM which has an unused lending capacity of 410 billion euros. The euro zone response package came after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero on Sunday. Central banks globally have take similar steps.  The European Central Bank, which took its own steps last week, has called on euro zone governments to mount an ambitious and coordinated fiscal response. ECB head Christine Lagarde told euro zone ministers the bank would do everything necessary to avoid fragmentation of the euro zone - EU code for large differences in bond prices among the 19 countries sharing the euro. Some economists believe the economic challenge facing the 27-nation EU and the euro zone could be bigger than the U.S. sub-prime mortgage crisis that hit Europe in 2008.  At that time, expecting a recession in 2009, EU leaders agreed to pump 1.5% of the bloc\u2019s GDP, or 200 billion euros, into the economy. The euro zone economy shrank 4.4% year-on-year anyway, but the extra spending might have limited the size of the recession.

If Europe wants to prove its value in this situation, it needs to act jointly.\u201d EU finance ministers were holding a video conference on new ways to respond to the economic damage caused by the coronavirus epidemic at 1400 GMT and were due to discuss the role of the EIB in that task. The re-prioritizing and re-purposing of money already in the EIB pipeline and redirecting some funds now used as a guarantee for the EU-leveraged investment scheme EFSI would together generate 28 billion euros, the EIB said.  Another 12 billion would come from leveraging an additional 1.5 billion euros freed by optimizing risk of the EU budget and the EIB balance sheet under the EFSI scheme, the bank said. \u201cEurope needs a \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 moment in the coronavirus response,\u201d Hoyer wrote to the ministers, pointing to the welcome shown by economists to the German plan to provide unlimited guarantees for companies hit by the epidemic. \u201cIt is different from bailout funds as it can help us get ahead of the problem to indeed avoid the need for bail-outs, calm markets and ensure that financial stability prevails,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIt would be an economic and political confidence-building measure to prevent insolvencies, instill confidence and ultimately help our European efforts to beat the virus,\u201d Hoyer said in the letter.

The talks will be held amid calls from EU lawmakers to allow an exceptional use of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to tackle the unprecedented health and economic crisis. The financial firepower of the ESM, the most powerful EU rescue fund, could provide the largest fiscal boost so far pledged at EU level. But such a move is still seen by many as potentially premature and hard to agree upon. Officials admitted that extraordinary options were being considered given the exceptional circumstances, with both the 27-country EU and 19-member euro zone economies expected to tip into recession this year. The fund was designed to help countries which lost market access, but that is not a problem at the moment as yields are still relatively low. But the ESM could help boost confidence, one euro zone official told Reuters, adding that how that could happen was under discussion. \u201cEuropean governments should commit to give access to the precautionary credit lines of the European Stability Mechanism for euro countries that are under pressure on capital markets due to the economic effects of the corona crisis,\u201d said Sven Giegold, a German lawmaker who leads on financial matters for the Greens grouping in the European Parliament. The ESM, which played a crucial role in rescuing euro zone states in 2010-2012 during the debt crisis, currently has a lending capacity of 410 billion euros. But access to its resources is linked to strict fiscal conditions, which would make the fund of no use under the current crisis.  Lawmakers are therefore calling for an exceptional use of the ESM, which Giegold said \u201cshould not be tied to any new austerity measures\u201d.  \u201cThe potential offered by the European Stability Mechanism must be used through a mandatory credit line to finance a common investment instrument,\u201d the EU Parliament\u2019s socialist grouping, the second-largest in the parliament, said in a statement on Monday. But Markus Ferber, the coordinator on financial affairs of the center-right grouping, the biggest in the EU Parliament, struck a cautious tone. \u201cThe ESM is a crisis management tool and if we open up the ESM funds this could also send a signal of imminent doom to the markets,\u201d he said.  He said that ESM precautionary credit lines would need the approval of national parliaments, including the German Bundestag which has in the past been very cautious in unblocking these funds. \u201cI would be surprised if we saw such a step this soon,\u201d Ferber told Reuters. At their videoconference on Monday, EU finance ministers are also expected to discuss a package of financial measures proposed by the EU Commission on Friday.  Under the package, Brussels offered to redirect 37 billion euros of EU funds to sectors in need, to allow states to run bigger budget deficits and to guarantee up to 8 billion euros for cheap loans to smaller firms. These measures need to be approved by governments and EU lawmakers. National governments have also pledged an array of national support measures. Berlin promised half a trillion euros in guarantees for German business, while Italy, the country most affected so far, has planned measures for crisis-hit sectors worth 25 billion euros and pledged to go further.

A comment by ECB chief Christine Lagarde that the central bank was not there to \u201cclose spreads\u201d hit peripheral government bond markets especially hard.      Italy\u2019s 10-year bond yield soared almost 60 basis points on the day to its highest level since July at around 1.88% - and was on track for its biggest one-day jump since the height of the euro zone debt crisis in 2011. The yield was slightly lower at 1.75% in late European trade.      The closely watched gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields, effectively the risk premium the latter pays on its debt - pushed out to its widest since June at around 261 bps.  The Portuguese/German bond yield gap rose to 145 bps - its widest in over a year, while Portuguese and Spanish yields were set for their biggest daily jump since 2016 with rises of 17-30 bps.     \u201cThe key bit was: \u2018we\u2019re not here to close spreads\u2019, that\u2019s kind of the opposite from \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 of Draghi,\u201d said Rabobank rates strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor, referring to former ECB chief Mario Draghi.     \u201cFor us, [if they call for] a fiscal response in the face of a severe economic crisis, without any debt mutualization, just sell peripherals all day long.\u201d Graphic: Italian spread jumps - here In a volatile session, safe-haven German bond yields swung wildly before heading back down in the face of heavy selling in stock markets and peripheral bonds.     Germany\u2019s two-year bond yield was marginally higher at -0.94%.     Earlier, the ECB said it would offer fresh loans to banks, provide previously agreed liquidity facilities at even more favorable rates and it would temporarily increase asset purchases to help the economy cope. But it disappointed markets by keeping interest rates unchanged.     \u201cShe delivered what was the consensus. Markets ... clearly they wanted a lot more,\u201d Barnaby Martin, head of credit strategy at BofA, said. A key gauge of euro zone inflation expectations hit a new record low at around 0.86%, far below the ECB\u2019s target of close to but below 2%.      The euro weakened nearly 1.8% to $1.10710 by 16:24 GMT, having briefly risen immediately after the ECB\u2019s announcement.    Graphic: European markets react to ECB - here Euro zone equities were set for their biggest one-day fall ever, sliding 11%, and at their lowest levels since June 2012. Euro zone banks also tumbled over 10%.  \u201cThere\u2019s a capitulation of some sorts given the total uncertainty of what\u2019s ahead of us,\u201d said Mikael Jacoby head of continental European equity sales at Oddo. \u201cThe ECB completely missed it, given the severity of the news flow, the actions taken were seen as very insufficient.\u201d The iTraxx European crossover CDS index, a gauge of the cost of insuring against defaults by junk debt issuers, rose as high as 596 bps, up over 50 bps after the ECB decision, according to Tradeweb.     \u201cIt\u2019s helpful that the interest rate on TLTROs can be as low as -0.75%, so there is significant easing but no change in the headline interest rates, which is not good for the euro and highlights the limited ammunition that the ECB has left,\u201d said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa.      Euro zone money market futures meanwhile scaled back expectations for future rate cuts, suggesting around an 80% chance of a 10bps cut by July.      Before the ECB decision, markets had positioned for two rate cuts by June.

The ECB launched a 750-billion-euro emergency bond purchase scheme to try to stop a pandemic-induced financial rout from shredding the euro zone\u2019s economy and raising new concerns about the currency bloc\u2019s viability. The new purchases bring this year\u2019s planned purchases to 1.1 trillion euros. The new purchases alone are worth 6% of the euro area\u2019s GDP. Italy, whose borrowing costs have spiked in recent days, saw its two-year yield slump as much as 100 basis points at one point. It was last down 66 bps on the day at 0.79% IT2YT=RR, set for its biggest one-day fall since mid-2018 .

Southern European bonds took a hit after ECB President Christine Lagarde said last week it was not the ECB\u2019s job to \u201cclose\u201d spreads. A series of clarifications followed but did not calm the markets.  On Wednesday, Italian yields surged, with 10-year yields rising above 3%. Worries emerged over whether Italy\u2019s debt can be sustained, since the government, already heavily indebted, will need to spend large sums to deal with coronavirus. ECB purchases will also for the first time include debt from Greece, which had been shut out because of its junk ratings. Now, around 12 billion euros in Greek government debt will be eligible for the purchases, according to Greece\u2019s finance minister. Greek 10-year yields, which had shot up nearly 300 bps over the last two weeks, fell by nearly 190 bps to 2.06%, set for their best day since July 2015.

More than a dozen EU countries have tightened or even shut borders that are usually open and uncontrolled, in response to the spreading epidemic. Because of these measures, \u201cdelays and disruption at country borders have been observed for the delivery of certain agricultural and manufactured products, as well as packaging materials,\u201d said a statement signed by trade associations representing EU farmers, food traders and the European food and drink industry. They also warned of potential labour shortages in the food industry as the sector relies on workers moving across the bloc. To try to avoid shortages of essential goods, food and medicines, EU leaders endorsed a proposal from the European Commission, the EU executive, on Tuesday to establish fast-track lanes at their countries\u2019 frontiers, but they did not agree to keep internal borders open. The industry said that was not enough.  \u201cWe welcome the recent Commission guidelines on border management as a good first step. Despite these guidelines, however, we continue to face severe disruptions,\u201d they said. They urged EU countries and institutions to prepare contingency plans for possible shortages of workers. \u201cGiven that the agri-food supply chain is highly integrated and operating across borders, any blocks of supply and workers will inevitably disrupt business. Our ability to provide food for all will depend on the preservation of the EU Single Market,\u201d the statement said. It called for the launch of fast-track lanes at border crossings that many states have not yet properly established. \u201cWe will continue to try to ensure that these are established, functional and that we alleviate any issue that arises with regard to the distribution and transit of products, in particular with food products and medical products,\u201d a spokesman for the European Commission said on Thursday. The joint industry statement was signed by FoodDrinkEurope, the trading body for the European food manufacturing industry, Copa and Cogeca, which represents farmers, and CELCAA, the EU umbrella association for trading companies in the food and commodities sectors.

The measure comes after EU countries failed for weeks to find a seller of face masks and goggles after they launched a joint procurement for these items at the beginning of March. The new strategic reserve would be complementary to joint procurement efforts which are underway, the EU commissioner for crisis management Janez Lenarcic told a news conference.  It remains unclear when the needed equipment could be bought, given the current strain on manufacturers which are mostly based in China and other Asian countries. To help Europe cope with the most immediate needs, China has offered to send 2.2 million masks and 50,000 testing kits to the EU, the head of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday.  The stockpile will be funded almost entirely with EU money, with a small fraction being covered with national resources of EU states.  The Commission said it had 10 million euros ($10.7 million) already available to build the reserve, and could use another 40 million euros if EU governments and lawmakers backed the extra spending. The actual purchase of needed equipment would be carried out by one of the 27 EU states, which will also host the stockpile. Many states have already offered to set up the reserve in their territory, Lenarcic said, a predictable move after France, Germany and a few other EU states which produce personal protective gear temporarily restricted exports to other EU nations at the beginning of the crisis, fearing shortages at home. Among the gear that the EU intends to stockpile is reusable masks, vaccines, drugs, laboratory supplies and intensive care medical equipment such as breathing ventilators. Under separate joint procurement procedures, the EU is currently assessing offers for gloves and body protection equipment, and is also already seeking to buy ventilators and laboratory equipment, including testing kits. Joint procurements are meant to facilitate purchases, lower prices and avoid harmful competition among member states. Many are also trying to acquire protective gear on their own. Last week China sent face masks to Italy, the European country worst-hit by the virus.

Mounting stress means she may have to do exactly that.  Wednesday\u2019s manic selloff showed as never before that strong words and action are required from the European Central Bank, beyond its offer last week of a temporary 120-billion addition to its asset purchase program to counter the coronavirus-linked damage to the bloc\u2019s economy.  Spreads \u2014 the gap between bond yields of a member state and benchmark issuer Germany, a gauge of the risk premium states with weaker credit metrics have to pay to borrow \u2014 have ballooned in recent days. In Italy\u2019s cases they have burgeoned towards levels that may start to herald debt distress and even the risk of euro zone break up. \u201cI think we need another \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 moment,\u201d said  Pictet Wealth Management strategist Frederik Ducrozet, referring to the pledge made by former ECB chief Mario Draghi during the bloc\u2019s 2012 crisis. He said the ECB needed to tell markets how exactly it would deploy the additional 120 billion euros and especially whether it would skew bond buys to those members facing stress, or overlook the constraints imposed by its own rules for now. \u201cWe need to know details. They could boost the number, they could issue a statement that there is no technical or legal obstacle to increase QE (quantitative easing),\u201d he said, a reference to rules allowing the ECB to hold only third of each country\u2019s bonds. It is nearing that limit in markets such as Germany.  But more ECB action may not of course fix the issue \u2014 aggressive rate cuts and far greater bond-buying by the U.S. Federal Reserve haven\u2019t calmed sentiment. U.S. stocks have continued to fall sharply. Still, pressure on the ECB is mounting in tandem with  Italy\u2019s 10-year bond yield spread over Germany. That blew out to 320 basis points on Wednesday, before tightening after reports the Bank of Italy was buying Italian paper to restore order in markets. DE10IT10=RR.  Also shoring up sentiment was a report that euro zone officials are considering how to deploy the unused firepower of the bloc\u2019s bailout fund to limit the economic damage, via a scheme that could pave the way for more ECB purchases of Italian bonds. Still, Italy\u2019s bond spread over Germany is around 70 bps wider than it was a week ago.  The Spanish/German 10-year bond spread, close to its widest since 2016 DE10ES10=RR, is 50 bps wider. And the Portuguese/German spread, at around 160 bps, is near its widest since May 2018 DE10PT10=RR.  That relentless widening reduces the efficacy of ECB monetary policy, analysts said. ECB asset purchases so far have been key to holding down government borrowing costs and keep bond spreads over benchmark issuer Germany tight. Marchel Alexandrovich, European financial economist at Jefferies, urged the ECB to quantify what they would buy. Speculation the program will be skewed towards corporate debt may have contributed to the government bond selloff. \u201cWe get some weekly numbers on public sector purchases but a week is a long time in a crisis like this, they need to tell us what they are buying on a day and show us what flexibility they are using on the capital key to support markets that are struggling.\u201d ECB government bond purchases are done in sync with each euro member country\u2019s shareholding in the bank, known as the capital key.  But it has been flexible with this before \u2014 and policymakers have stressed that after Lagarde\u2019s comment last week that it was not the ECB\u2019s job to \u201cclose\u201d spreads. Financial conditions have materially changed since the ECB\u2019s meeting last week and further steps may be necessary to prop up the economy, Finnish central bank chief Olli Rehn said Wednesday.       \u201cWe expect the ECB to step up its QE, ISIN (bond issuer)limits and even more deviations from capital key, with a total envelope of at least 500 billion when the BTP-Bund spread hits 350-400 bps, which we expect in coming days,\u201d said Piet Haines Christiansen, chief strategist at Danske Bank.

Italy is battling Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of coronavirus, which is spreading across the continent, including the 19 countries that use the euro.   The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) bailout fund was created at the height of last decade\u2019s sovereign debt crisis to be a lender of last resort to governments cut off from markets. It has 410 billion euros of unused lending capacity. No euro zone government, including highly indebted Italy, is even close to losing market access, but some politicians believe that getting the ESM involved would reassure investors and help stabilize volatile government bond markets. The brainstorming is tough because of established divisions between fiscally strict and less frugal euro zone countries and because the ESM does not have any instruments designed specifically for emergencies like the pandemic. Two officials said an idea being considered is for all euro zone governments to apply for a stand-by credit line from the ESM to show markets they have serious money, if needed, to finance the challenge to their health systems and support crumbling economic growth. A joint application would also remove the stigma for a single country, like Italy, of asking for help.  Italy\u2019s very high and rising debt makes it ineligible for a Precautionary Conditioned Credit Line from the ESM, officials said, meaning that countries would have to ask for an      Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL). But the tougher conditions attached to the latter could make it politically less palatable for governments including Rome. An ECCL scenario could allow the European Central Bank could step in with its Outright Monetary Transactions program of unlimited sovereign bond buying, provided the ESM committed to buying government bonds on the primary market. ESM funds could be distributed on the basis of the ECB\u2019s capital key, which would give Italy, the euro zone\u2019s third-largest economy, a very sizeable chunk of the money. \u201cIn my mind, an ECCL would work for Italy,\u201d one senior euro zone official privy to the discussions said.   To make the conditions attached to the ECCL easier to swallow, they could be focused on the specific challenges posed by the coronavirus, rather than encompass a general overhaul of the economy. \u201cIf they insist on tax money from other countries without any conditions, that is in the end their responsibility,\u201d the official said. Nothing was being ruled out at the moment, he added \u201cbut in the end it will boil down to facts to support what the best way forward is.\u201d     Reporting by Jan Strupczewski; Editing by Catherine Evans", "date_posted": "2020-03-21T21:33:42.665Z", "image": ""}}, {"model": "news.post", "pk": 109, "fields": {"title": "Euro zone pledges 'whatever it takes' to fight coronavirus\u00a0effects", "category": "agroculture", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-response/euro-zone-pledges-whatever-it-takes-to-fight-coronavirus-effects-idUSKBN21300F", "content": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers pledged on Monday an \u201cunlimited\u201d commitment to fight the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, saying they would do whatever it takes and more to restore confidence and a rapid recovery. The promise came after a five-hour videoconference as the European Commission forecast the effects of the pandemic would turn the previously expected 1.4% European Union economic growth this year into a 1% recession or worse, as whole sectors of the economy are put out of operation. \u201cFinance ministers are often posed very hard choices, but seldom on matters of life and death,\u201d the chairman of the ministers, Mario Centeno, told a televised news conference.  \u201cWe will protect our citizens and our currency come what may and with everything we have got. Our commitment to provide support in this time of need will be unlimited,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe will do whatever it takes and more to restore confidence and support a rapid recovery. Whatever further coordinated and decisive policies are needed, we stand ready to make them,\u201d he said. Asked by the ministers, the European Commission estimated that euro zone fiscal support to the economy announced so far amounted to about 1% of gross domestic product, or 120 billion euros ($134 billion), for 2020. The euro zone has also already committed at least 10% of its GDP, or some 1.2 trillion euros, in public guarantee schemes and deferred tax payments to help companies that could go bankrupt because of the epidemic and workers who could be laid off as a result of the slowdown.  \u201cThese figures could be much larger going forward,\u201d the ministers said in a joint statement. In addition, the ministers pledged to make full use of increased state spending for various welfare benefits deployed during economic downturns, or what the EU calls automatic stabilizers. Centeno said EU budget rules - the Stability and Growth Pact - which normally put limits on government spending and borrowing to safeguard the euro, would be suspended for now. \u201cThe Stability and Growth Pact will not stand in the way of our fight of this disease and its economic consequences,\u201d he said. The epidemic puts the EU economy in uncharted waters because it has already led to lockdowns in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Denmark, the Czech Republic, and Poland, and caused curbs on businesses and the movement of people in many countries. The ministers said that each country would decide individually how they would provide liquidity support for firms facing severe disruption and liquidity shortages in severely affected sectors. Transport and tourism have virtually ground to a halt because of the pandemic. Support could encompass tax measures, public guarantees to help companies to borrow, export guarantees, and waiving of delay penalties in public procurement contracts. Workers facing the loss of jobs or income would get short-term work support, extension of sick pay and unemployment benefits, and deferral of income tax payments. Individual state moves so far have included Germany promising half a trillion euros in guarantees for its business - and more if needed. France has promised support for French companies and Italy will allocate 25 billion euros to Italian firms and families.  Separately, the European Commission proposed last Friday a 37-billion euro investment initiative        The European Investment Bank, owned by the EU governments, would provide almost 40 billion euros to help firms stay afloat and the euro zone would explore ways to use its bailout fund ESM which has an unused lending capacity of 410 billion euros. The euro zone response package came after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero on Sunday. Central banks globally have take similar steps.  The European Central Bank, which took its own steps last week, has called on euro zone governments to mount an ambitious and coordinated fiscal response. ECB head Christine Lagarde told euro zone ministers the bank would do everything necessary to avoid fragmentation of the euro zone - EU code for large differences in bond prices among the 19 countries sharing the euro. Some economists believe the economic challenge facing the 27-nation EU and the euro zone could be bigger than the U.S. sub-prime mortgage crisis that hit Europe in 2008.  At that time, expecting a recession in 2009, EU leaders agreed to pump 1.5% of the bloc\u2019s GDP, or 200 billion euros, into the economy. The euro zone economy shrank 4.4% year-on-year anyway, but the extra spending might have limited the size of the recession.

The talks will be held amid calls from EU lawmakers to allow an exceptional use of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to tackle the unprecedented health and economic crisis. The financial firepower of the ESM, the most powerful EU rescue fund, could provide the largest fiscal boost so far pledged at EU level. But such a move is still seen by many as potentially premature and hard to agree upon. Officials admitted that extraordinary options were being considered given the exceptional circumstances, with both the 27-country EU and 19-member euro zone economies expected to tip into recession this year. The fund was designed to help countries which lost market access, but that is not a problem at the moment as yields are still relatively low. But the ESM could help boost confidence, one euro zone official told Reuters, adding that how that could happen was under discussion. \u201cEuropean governments should commit to give access to the precautionary credit lines of the European Stability Mechanism for euro countries that are under pressure on capital markets due to the economic effects of the corona crisis,\u201d said Sven Giegold, a German lawmaker who leads on financial matters for the Greens grouping in the European Parliament. The ESM, which played a crucial role in rescuing euro zone states in 2010-2012 during the debt crisis, currently has a lending capacity of 410 billion euros. But access to its resources is linked to strict fiscal conditions, which would make the fund of no use under the current crisis.  Lawmakers are therefore calling for an exceptional use of the ESM, which Giegold said \u201cshould not be tied to any new austerity measures\u201d.  \u201cThe potential offered by the European Stability Mechanism must be used through a mandatory credit line to finance a common investment instrument,\u201d the EU Parliament\u2019s socialist grouping, the second-largest in the parliament, said in a statement on Monday. But Markus Ferber, the coordinator on financial affairs of the center-right grouping, the biggest in the EU Parliament, struck a cautious tone. \u201cThe ESM is a crisis management tool and if we open up the ESM funds this could also send a signal of imminent doom to the markets,\u201d he said.  He said that ESM precautionary credit lines would need the approval of national parliaments, including the German Bundestag which has in the past been very cautious in unblocking these funds. \u201cI would be surprised if we saw such a step this soon,\u201d Ferber told Reuters. At their videoconference on Monday, EU finance ministers are also expected to discuss a package of financial measures proposed by the EU Commission on Friday.  Under the package, Brussels offered to redirect 37 billion euros of EU funds to sectors in need, to allow states to run bigger budget deficits and to guarantee up to 8 billion euros for cheap loans to smaller firms. These measures need to be approved by governments and EU lawmakers. National governments have also pledged an array of national support measures.

A comment by ECB chief Christine Lagarde that the central bank was not there to \u201cclose spreads\u201d hit peripheral government bond markets especially hard.      Italy\u2019s 10-year bond yield soared almost 60 basis points on the day to its highest level since July at around 1.88% - and was on track for its biggest one-day jump since the height of the euro zone debt crisis in 2011. The yield was slightly lower at 1.75% in late European trade.      The closely watched gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields, effectively the risk premium the latter pays on its debt - pushed out to its widest since June at around 261 bps.  The Portuguese/German bond yield gap rose to 145 bps - its widest in over a year, while Portuguese and Spanish yields were set for their biggest daily jump since 2016 with rises of 17-30 bps.     \u201cThe key bit was: \u2018we\u2019re not here to close spreads\u2019, that\u2019s kind of the opposite from \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 of Draghi,\u201d said Rabobank rates strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor, referring to former ECB chief Mario Draghi.     \u201cFor us, [if they call for] a fiscal response in the face of a severe economic crisis, without any debt mutualization, just sell peripherals all day long.\u201d Graphic: Italian spread jumps - here In a volatile session, safe-haven German bond yields swung wildly before heading back down in the face of heavy selling in stock markets and peripheral bonds.     Germany\u2019s two-year bond yield was marginally higher at -0.94%.     Earlier, the ECB said it would offer fresh loans to banks, provide previously agreed liquidity facilities at even more favorable rates and it would temporarily increase asset purchases to help the economy cope. But it disappointed markets by keeping interest rates unchanged.     \u201cShe delivered what was the consensus. Markets ... clearly they wanted a lot more,\u201d Barnaby Martin, head of credit strategy at BofA, said. A key gauge of euro zone inflation expectations hit a new record low at around 0.86%, far below the ECB\u2019s target of close to but below 2%.      The euro weakened nearly 1.8% to $1.10710 by 16:24 GMT, having briefly risen immediately after the ECB\u2019s announcement.    Graphic: European markets react to ECB - here Euro zone equities were set for their biggest one-day fall ever, sliding 11%, and at their lowest levels since June 2012. Euro zone banks also tumbled over 10%.  \u201cThere\u2019s a capitulation of some sorts given the total uncertainty of what\u2019s ahead of us,\u201d said Mikael Jacoby head of continental European equity sales at Oddo. \u201cThe ECB completely missed it, given the severity of the news flow, the actions taken were seen as very insufficient.\u201d The iTraxx European crossover CDS index, a gauge of the cost of insuring against defaults by junk debt issuers, rose as high as 596 bps, up over 50 bps after the ECB decision, according to Tradeweb.     \u201cIt\u2019s helpful that the interest rate on TLTROs can be as low as -0.75%, so there is significant easing but no change in the headline interest rates, which is not good for the euro and highlights the limited ammunition that the ECB has left,\u201d said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa.      Euro zone money market futures meanwhile scaled back expectations for future rate cuts, suggesting around an 80% chance of a 10bps cut by July.      Before the ECB decision, markets had positioned for two rate cuts by June.

Tourism revenue rose to a record high $12.57 billion in the financial year that ended in July 2019. The most populous Arab country said on Thursday it would shut all cafes, shopping malls, sports clubs and nightclubs from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. local time every night until March 31. It exempted supermarkets, pharmacies, bakeries and neighborhood corner stores. Egypt also shut schools and universities and moved to cut the number of public sector employees reporting to work in an effort to discourage crowding and slow the spread of the disease. Flights were grounded on Thursday until the end of March, with the exception of outward-bound flights needed by foreign tourists. The government said that during the flight ban and school shutdown, hotels and all educational facilities would be sanitized.

Jordan has closed land and sea border crossings with Syria, Iraq, Egypt and Israel, and suspended all incoming and outgoing flights since Tuesday. King Abdullah enacted an emergency decree giving the government sweeping powers to enforce an army-imposed curfew and other measures that restrict civil and political liberties. Health Minister Saad Jaber said on Friday that Jordan had 85 confirmed cases of coronavirus, after 15 new cases were identified, with officials warning that numbers could rise. The curfew came after officials criticized the presence of many people on the streets even after warnings to stay at home, a ban on gatherings and public worship, and suspension of work for civil servants and private companies. \u201cUnfortunately we have seen recklessness in scenes of shopping and moving around in the streets.

The detentions have complicated ties between the two countries during a period when Macron was seeking to defuse tensions between Washington and Tehran. Iran Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals in recent years, mostly on espionage charges.

The world\u2019s richest nations poured unprecedented aid into the global economy as coronavirus cases ballooned across Europe and the United States, with the number of deaths in Italy outstripping those in mainland China, where the virus originated. With over 270,000 infections and more than 11,000 deaths, the epidemic has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with  periods such as World War Two and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.  \u201cAll you need is panic buying from big importers such as millers or governments to create a crisis,\u201d said Abdolreza Abbassian, chief economist at the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). \u201cIt is not a supply issue, but it is a behavioral change over food security,\u201d he told Reuters by phone from Rome, the FAO headquarters. \u201cWhat if bulk buyers think they can\u2019t get wheat or rice shipments in May or June? That is what could lead to a global food supply crisis.\u201d Graphic: Stocks of global crop staples - here Consumers across the world from Singapore to the United States have queued at super markets in recent weeks to stock up on items ranging from rice and hand sanitizers to toilet paper. The global benchmark Chicago wheat futures rose more than 6% this week, the biggest weekly gain in nine months, while rice prices in Thailand, the world\u2019s 2nd largest exporter of the grain, have climbed to the highest since August 2013. France\u2019s grain industry is scrambling to find enough trucks and staff to keep factories and ports running as the panic buying of pasta and flour coincides with a surge in wheat exports. Restrictions imposed by some European Union countries at their borders with other member states in response to the pandemic are also disrupting food supplies, representatives of the industry and farmers said. However, global wheat stocks at the end of the crop marketing year in June are projected to rise to 287.14 million tonnes, up from 277.57 million tonnes a year ago, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates.

Oil prices LCOc1CLc1 have lost more than half their value in the last two weeks as Saudi Arabia and Russia kicked off a price war and the coronavirus pandemic destroyed demand. U.S. oil now trades at less than $23 a barrel. The crash has shocked the oil industry as a pact among OPEC and non-OPEC producers to cooperate imploded, triggering a  production free-for-all.  The United States is sending a special representative to negotiate with Saudi Arabia, officials said Friday, after the kingdom unleashed production following years of touting its role as a stabilizing force for markets. Saudi Arabia and Russia are locked in a war for global oil market share after their three-year deal to restrain output collapsed this month. The kingdom has vowed to increase production to a record 12.3 million barrels per day, and has chartered numerous tankers to ship oil around the world, pushing prices to near 20-year lows this week. U.S. officials believe Saudi Arabia\u2019s move to flood oil markets compounds the global economic crash during a crisis caused by the pandemic.  A senior Energy Department official will be sent to Riyadh for months at least to work closely with State Department officials and the existing energy attache, the senior U.S. officials said, on condition of anonymity. Trump administration officials said Saudi Arabia has for decades been a steadfast leader of stability in the global oil market. The energy representative would help the countries return to a path of stability, they said.  The price crash is also devastating to U.S. oil producers, some of which have already begun putting employees on furlough.  The hope is that President Donald Trump could negotiate with Saudi Arabia and Russia and convince them to match cuts with a similar cut in production in Texas, said Ryan Sitton, a commissioner with the Texas Railroad Commission, the body that regulates the state\u2019s oil and gas industry. Sitton said production limits could be implemented quickly, though no one who works at the agency was around the last time the state limited production, in the early 1970s.  \u201cWe need to take the time to hear from everybody,\u201d he said, adding that he was not yet advocating for the cuts. But \u201cif we can help (Trump) get a deal done, then I think that\u2019s when we do something.\u201d Sitton said on Twitter that he spoke with OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo about an international deal \u201cto ensure economic stability as we recover from\u201d the coronavirus outbreak. Sitton said Barkindo was \u201ckind enough to invite me to the next OPEC meeting in June.\u201d Barkindo told Reuters that he and Sitton discussed their \u201cperspective on current developments, and the possibility of future cooperation\u201d in a teleconference. Barkindo and OPEC ministers have, in the past, met with shale-industry executives at annual conferences. A senior State Department official said the federal government does not have the ability to restrict the Texas regulator from any work with OPEC to cut production.  \u201cThose are wholly within state matters ... from a federal level we have no ongoing engagements with OPEC, it\u2019s a cartel,\u201d the official told reporters in a teleconference.  Some U.S. industry representatives were skeptical that Texas should intervene in the market. U.S. oil producers have long resisted such a move, and the industry\u2019s largest trade association did not sound convinced on Friday, either. \u201cOur view is simple. Quotas are bad,\u201d said Frank Macchiarola, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs at the American Petroleum Institute. \u201cThey\u2019ve been proven ineffective and harmful. There\u2019s no reason during this time to try to imitate OPEC.\u201d In the last several years, shale operators using the innovative hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technique, have boosted U.S. oil output to nearly 13 million barrels per day, making it the world\u2019s largest producer. Since 2016, as OPEC restrained production, the United States has taken market share from Saudi Arabia, Russia and other nations. Russia has been slower to come on board with OPEC\u2019s continued efforts to bolster prices, and the country\u2019s largest oil producer, Rosneft (ROSN.MM), has been an opponent of the deal with OPEC to cut supply. Units of Rosneft, and its managers, were recently sanctioned by the United States due to its trade relationship with Venezuela. Trump administration officials will continue to reduce global oil output with sanctions on what the officials called bad actors in Iran and Venezuela, both of which are OPEC members, and their shipping networks, the officials said. To the extent that Russia is involved in marketing Venezuelan oil, it will be sanctioned, the officials said. A group of nine Republican U.S. Senators, mainly from oil producing states, urged Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross late on Friday to investigate whether Saudi Arabia and Russia were excessively dumping oil on global markets.

These two (Russia and Saudi Arabia) are the largest oil producers, and of course, we need to cooperate, to exchange information,\u201d Sechin said, according to RIA.  He added that Rosneft was prepared for a dramatic fall in oil prices which followed a collapse of an existing oil output cut deal between OPEC and non-OPEC nations, saying that global oil prices could return to $60 per barrel by end-2020 if shale oil is forced out of the market.  Sechin, who had previously publicly opposed the three-year-long deal to coordinate global oil production, said that OPEC+ - as the current cooperation is known - has lost its power since other factors currently are affecting the price of oil.  Sechin said there are a number of oil producing countries in the world which never were part of the deal and do not want to join it now either. \u201cIs there a point to cut further if other producers will increase?\u201d, he said.  The existing deal will end on March 31, after Moscow and Riyadh failed to reach an agreement in Vienna this month on global oil production. Russia proposed to extend cuts to see the coronavirus impact on the oil demand while OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, wanted to deepen the cuts. Brent crude prices fell $1.49, or 5.2%, to settle at $26.98 a barrel on Friday, far below the $46 barrels per day on March 6 when the deal collapsed. With no oil cooperation deal, Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world\u2019s two top oil exporters, have fallen into an oil price war, something Sechin said was unavoidable as Moscow needs to keep its share and prevent non-members from benefiting from the cuts. \u201cIf you give up your (oil) market share, you will never return back to there, and here is the point. The price will adjust (sooner or later). But if you lose your customers, you will never win them back again,\u201d Sechin said, according to RIA.

Said Pompeo: \u201cLet me just get back to you on the answer to that.\u201d The Pentagon said last week that Trump had authorized the U.S. military to respond to the March 11 rocket attack in Iraq. Trump has been preoccupied with addressing the coronavirus pandemic. The United States has blamed Iran-backed militia for the attack but has not yet said whether it was linked to the Iranian leadership in Tehran. Tensions have been running high between the two longtime adversaries since Trump ordered a U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3. When Pompeo was asked about whether Iran was responsible, Trump interjected: \u201cWe know plenty.\u201d Pompeo added: \u201cWe\u2019ve made clear that the Iraqi Shi\u2019a militias are funded, trained and equipped by the Iranians. We\u2019ve urged the Iranians not to do that. We\u2019ve told the Iranians that they will be held responsible for those attacks when they threaten American lives.\u201d Despite the tensions, the United States has offered humanitarian assistance to Iran while it struggles with the coronavirus outbreak. Iran is one of the countries outside China that has been most affected by the pandemic. On Friday, Iran said its death toll from the outbreak rose to 1,433. Pompeo suggested that tough U.S. sanctions on Iran would continue over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs despite some appeals for them to be relaxed due to the virus. \u201cThe whole world should know that humanitarian assistance into Iran is wide open. It\u2019s not sanctioned,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no sanction on medicines going to Iran, there\u2019s no sanctions on humanitarian assistance going into that country. They\u2019ve got a terrible problem there and we want that humanitarian medical health-care assistance to get to the people of Iran,\u201d he said. Trump said in a message to Iran to mark the Nowruz holiday that \u201cthe people of Iran have made it clear that they want leadership that represents them, not the interests of its corrupt regime.\u201d \u201cThe Iranian people deserve leaders who listen to, respect, and invest in them, not leaders who target and persecute them while wasting money to advance their nuclear ambitions and test more missiles,\u201d he said.

France had demanded that Iran release Marchal, a senior researcher at Sciences Po university whose arrest was reported by Paris in mid-October. The French Foreign Ministry and the presidential palace declined to comment. The released Iranian\u2019s lawyer did not respond to text messages. There had been talk of an exchange being discussed, but French officials had refused to comment directly, saying only that there had been progress in recent days.  In May, a French court approved the extradition of Rouhollahnejad to the United States to face charges of attempting to illegally import U.S. technology for military purposes on behalf of an Iranian company which U.S. officials said was linked to the elite Revolutionary Guards. The detentions have complicated ties between the two countries during a period when French President Emmanuel Macron was seeking to defuse tensions between Washington and Tehran. Iran Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals in recent years, mostly on espionage charges. The detentions have coincided with a protracted standoff with Western powers prompted by a U.S. decision to withdraw from an international agreement to curb Iranian nuclear activities. Rights activists have accused Iran of arresting the dual nationals and foreign citizens in an attempt to win concessions from other countries - a charge that the Islamic Republic has regularly dismissed.

The week featured four days of massive selling as the growing pandemic kept people from driving and booking flights. Major forecasters like trading giant Vitol and energy researcher IHS Markit said oil demand could drop by as much as 10%. Oil prices rose sharply on Thursday after days of selling, but the rally did not last. U.S. crude prices notched a weekly loss of 29%, the steepest since the outset of the U.S./Iraq Gulf War in 1991. Brent crude dropped by 20%. Both benchmarks have dropped for four straight weeks. \u201cWith the economy continuing to grind more and more to a halt, it\u2019s clear the demand destruction is continuing to grow. Whatever efforts are being made to cut production in the U.S. and capital expenditures, it\u2019s not enough right now,\u201d said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. On Friday, Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell $1.49, or 5.2%, to settle at $26.98 a barrel. U.S. crude futures for April CLc1 fell $2.69, or 10.7%, to settle at $22.53 a barrel. The front-month contract expires on Friday. The more active U.S. crude contract for May CLc2 settled down $3.28, or 12.7%, at $22.63. U.S. crude has lost half its value in the past two weeks, and Brent has dropped about 40%, as the pandemic has cut demand at the same time as a collapse of coordinated output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producers including Russia.  U.S. officials scrambled to respond on Friday, saying they would send a U.S. Energy Department official to Saudi Arabia for several months to work on stabilizing energy markets. Also, a Texas state regulator spoke with OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo about the possibility of a global production cut. Texas regulators have not intervened to cut output among state producers since 1973. The American Petroleum Institute weighed in against the idea on Friday, saying quotas do not work. \u201cAs far as a coordinated response with OPEC, it\u2019s hard to see a plan coming together along those lines,\u201d Kilduff said. Prices dropped sharply just before Friday\u2019s close, as hedge funds and other money managers rushed to get out of the contract on its final day of trading, pushing the expiring April contract down by twice as much as the current May contract, said Bob Yawger, director of Energy Futures for Mizuho.  Saudi Arabia said it would push its production to a record 12.3 million bpd and booked shipments to send oil around the globe, refusing entreaties to rein in output. U.S. elected officials have urged the Trump Administration to get involved. Traders and analysts were scrambling to revise down forecasts for oil demand, as government lockdowns to contain the coronavirus outbreak have rapidly cut fuel consumption.  \u201cGlobal demand could easily drop by 10 million barrels per day or more,\u201d said Giovanni Serio, head of research at Vitol. Others, including IHS Markit and Standard Chartered bank, have made similar predictions.

Many on social media had criticized the government for not cancelling weekly Friday prayers and masses at which worshippers crowd into mosques and churches. The Ministry of Islamic Endowments said it would shut all mosques for two weeks \u201cfor the necessity of preserving souls\u201d, but will allow them to broadcast prayer calls through loudspeakers.  In another statement, the ministry stressed that mosques will not open during the closure even for funeral prayers, adding such sermons should be done in open areas. Egypt has more than 100,000 mosques. Al-Azhar, Egypt\u2019s top Sunni Muslim authority, said it would shut its historic mosque in old Cairo starting from Saturday \u201cfor the safety of worshippers, and until the end of the coronavirus epidemic\u201d.

Each parish will name only one church for funeral prayers and the sermons will be restricted to the family of the deceased. Christians represent around 10% of Egypt\u2019s population of 100 million, according to unofficial estimates. The vast majority of the country\u2019s Christians are orthodox. The Coptic Catholic Church followed the same approach\u202e\u202e \u202c\u202cand ordered its followers on Saturday to pray at home until further notice.

Strengthening measures Egypt, which has seen its tourism sector badly affected by the epidemic, will close all museums and archaeological sites starting March 23 until the end of the month for sanitization, the tourism ministry said in a statement on Saturday. Tourism revenue rose to a record high $12.57 billion in the financial year that ended in July 2019. The most populous Arab country said on Thursday it would shut all cafes, shopping malls, sports clubs and nightclubs from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. local time every night until March 31. It exempted supermarkets, pharmacies, bakeries and neighborhood corner stores. Egypt also shut schools and universities and moved to cut the number of public sector employees reporting to work in an effort to discourage crowding and slow the spread of the disease. Flights were grounded on Thursday until the end of March, with the exception of outward-bound flights needed by foreign tourists. The government said that during the flight ban and school shutdown, hotels and all educational facilities would be sanitized.

The world\u2019s richest nations poured unprecedented aid into the global economy as coronavirus cases ballooned across Europe and the United States, with the number of deaths in Italy outstripping those in mainland China, where the virus originated. With over 270,000 infections and more than 11,000 deaths, the epidemic has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with  periods such as World War Two and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.  \u201cAll you need is panic buying from big importers such as millers or governments to create a crisis,\u201d said Abdolreza Abbassian, chief economist at the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). \u201cIt is not a supply issue, but it is a behavioral change over food security,\u201d he told Reuters by phone from Rome, the FAO headquarters. \u201cWhat if bulk buyers think they can\u2019t get wheat or rice shipments in May or June? That is what could lead to a global food supply crisis.\u201d Graphic: Stocks of global crop staples - here Consumers across the world from Singapore to the United States have queued at super markets in recent weeks to stock up on items ranging from rice and hand sanitizers to toilet paper. The global benchmark Chicago wheat futures rose more than 6% this week, the biggest weekly gain in nine months, while rice prices in Thailand, the world\u2019s 2nd largest exporter of the grain, have climbed to the highest since August 2013. France\u2019s grain industry is scrambling to find enough trucks and staff to keep factories and ports running as the panic buying of pasta and flour coincides with a surge in wheat exports. Restrictions imposed by some European Union countries at their borders with other member states in response to the pandemic are also disrupting food supplies, representatives of the industry and farmers said. However, global wheat stocks at the end of the crop marketing year in June are projected to rise to 287.14 million tonnes, up from 277.57 million tonnes a year ago, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates.

The rebel-held northwest was already facing a major humanitarian crisis with nearly one million people displaced by fighting in the past few months as the Russian-backed government mounted an offensive. U.N. political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo said on Friday that she had heard from sources on the ground about the potentially devastating impact of coronavirus in Syria. \u201cIf anyone - incredibly - still needed a reason to stop the fighting there, this is it,\u201d DiCarlo posted on Twitter.

The Kurdish-led administration has banned movement between towns in its region starting from Saturday and a curfew will begin Monday. In the opposition-held northwest, rescue workers whose usual role is to respond to government bombardments have been sanitizing classrooms. Medics in the northwest fear the virus would spread very quickly in crowded camps for the displaced. All the countries bordering Syria have coronavirus outbreaks.

Oil prices LCOc1CLc1 have lost more than half their value in the last two weeks as Saudi Arabia and Russia kicked off a price war and the coronavirus pandemic destroyed demand. U.S. oil now trades at less than $23 a barrel. The crash has shocked the oil industry as a pact among OPEC and non-OPEC producers to cooperate imploded, triggering a  production free-for-all.  The United States is sending a special representative to negotiate with Saudi Arabia, officials said Friday, after the kingdom unleashed production following years of touting its role as a stabilizing force for markets. Saudi Arabia and Russia are locked in a war for global oil market share after their three-year deal to restrain output collapsed this month. The kingdom has vowed to increase production to a record 12.3 million barrels per day, and has chartered numerous tankers to ship oil around the world, pushing prices to near 20-year lows this week. U.S. officials believe Saudi Arabia\u2019s move to flood oil markets compounds the global economic crash during a crisis caused by the pandemic.  A senior Energy Department official will be sent to Riyadh for months at least to work closely with State Department officials and the existing energy attache, the senior U.S. officials said, on condition of anonymity. Trump administration officials said Saudi Arabia has for decades been a steadfast leader of stability in the global oil market. The energy representative would help the countries return to a path of stability, they said.  The price crash is also devastating to U.S. oil producers, some of which have already begun putting employees on furlough.  The hope is that President Donald Trump could negotiate with Saudi Arabia and Russia and convince them to match cuts with a similar cut in production in Texas, said Ryan Sitton, a commissioner with the Texas Railroad Commission, the body that regulates the state\u2019s oil and gas industry. Sitton said production limits could be implemented quickly, though no one who works at the agency was around the last time the state limited production, in the early 1970s.  \u201cWe need to take the time to hear from everybody,\u201d he said, adding that he was not yet advocating for the cuts. But \u201cif we can help (Trump) get a deal done, then I think that\u2019s when we do something.\u201d Sitton said on Twitter that he spoke with OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo about an international deal \u201cto ensure economic stability as we recover from\u201d the coronavirus outbreak. Sitton said Barkindo was \u201ckind enough to invite me to the next OPEC meeting in June.\u201d Barkindo told Reuters that he and Sitton discussed their \u201cperspective on current developments, and the possibility of future cooperation\u201d in a teleconference. Barkindo and OPEC ministers have, in the past, met with shale-industry executives at annual conferences. A senior State Department official said the federal government does not have the ability to restrict the Texas regulator from any work with OPEC to cut production.  \u201cThose are wholly within state matters ... from a federal level we have no ongoing engagements with OPEC, it\u2019s a cartel,\u201d the official told reporters in a teleconference.  Some U.S. industry representatives were skeptical that Texas should intervene in the market. U.S. oil producers have long resisted such a move, and the industry\u2019s largest trade association did not sound convinced on Friday, either. \u201cOur view is simple. Quotas are bad,\u201d said Frank Macchiarola, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs at the American Petroleum Institute. \u201cThey\u2019ve been proven ineffective and harmful. There\u2019s no reason during this time to try to imitate OPEC.\u201d In the last several years, shale operators using the innovative hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technique, have boosted U.S. oil output to nearly 13 million barrels per day, making it the world\u2019s largest producer. Since 2016, as OPEC restrained production, the United States has taken market share from Saudi Arabia, Russia and other nations. Russia has been slower to come on board with OPEC\u2019s continued efforts to bolster prices, and the country\u2019s largest oil producer, Rosneft (ROSN.MM), has been an opponent of the deal with OPEC to cut supply. Units of Rosneft, and its managers, were recently sanctioned by the United States due to its trade relationship with Venezuela. Trump administration officials will continue to reduce global oil output with sanctions on what the officials called bad actors in Iran and Venezuela, both of which are OPEC members, and their shipping networks, the officials said. To the extent that Russia is involved in marketing Venezuelan oil, it will be sanctioned, the officials said. A group of nine Republican U.S. Senators, mainly from oil producing states, urged Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross late on Friday to investigate whether Saudi Arabia and Russia were excessively dumping oil on global markets.

These two (Russia and Saudi Arabia) are the largest oil producers, and of course, we need to cooperate, to exchange information,\u201d Sechin said, according to RIA.  He added that Rosneft was prepared for a dramatic fall in oil prices which followed a collapse of an existing oil output cut deal between OPEC and non-OPEC nations, saying that global oil prices could return to $60 per barrel by end-2020 if shale oil is forced out of the market.  Sechin, who had previously publicly opposed the three-year-long deal to coordinate global oil production, said that OPEC+ - as the current cooperation is known - has lost its power since other factors currently are affecting the price of oil.  Sechin said there are a number of oil producing countries in the world which never were part of the deal and do not want to join it now either. \u201cIs there a point to cut further if other producers will increase?\u201d, he said.  The existing deal will end on March 31, after Moscow and Riyadh failed to reach an agreement in Vienna this month on global oil production. Russia proposed to extend cuts to see the coronavirus impact on the oil demand while OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, wanted to deepen the cuts. Brent crude prices fell $1.49, or 5.2%, to settle at $26.98 a barrel on Friday, far below the $46 barrels per day on March 6 when the deal collapsed. With no oil cooperation deal, Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world\u2019s two top oil exporters, have fallen into an oil price war, something Sechin said was unavoidable as Moscow needs to keep its share and prevent non-members from benefiting from the cuts. \u201cIf you give up your (oil) market share, you will never return back to there, and here is the point. The price will adjust (sooner or later). But if you lose your customers, you will never win them back again,\u201d Sechin said, according to RIA.

Said Pompeo: \u201cLet me just get back to you on the answer to that.\u201d The Pentagon said last week that Trump had authorized the U.S. military to respond to the March 11 rocket attack in Iraq. Trump has been preoccupied with addressing the coronavirus pandemic. The United States has blamed Iran-backed militia for the attack but has not yet said whether it was linked to the Iranian leadership in Tehran. Tensions have been running high between the two longtime adversaries since Trump ordered a U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3. When Pompeo was asked about whether Iran was responsible, Trump interjected: \u201cWe know plenty.\u201d Pompeo added: \u201cWe\u2019ve made clear that the Iraqi Shi\u2019a militias are funded, trained and equipped by the Iranians. We\u2019ve urged the Iranians not to do that. We\u2019ve told the Iranians that they will be held responsible for those attacks when they threaten American lives.\u201d Despite the tensions, the United States has offered humanitarian assistance to Iran while it struggles with the coronavirus outbreak. Iran is one of the countries outside China that has been most affected by the pandemic. On Friday, Iran said its death toll from the outbreak rose to 1,433. Pompeo suggested that tough U.S. sanctions on Iran would continue over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs despite some appeals for them to be relaxed due to the virus. \u201cThe whole world should know that humanitarian assistance into Iran is wide open.

The week featured four days of massive selling as the growing pandemic kept people from driving and booking flights. Major forecasters like trading giant Vitol and energy researcher IHS Markit said oil demand could drop by as much as 10%. Oil prices rose sharply on Thursday after days of selling, but the rally did not last. U.S. crude prices notched a weekly loss of 29%, the steepest since the outset of the U.S./Iraq Gulf War in 1991. Brent crude dropped by 20%. Both benchmarks have dropped for four straight weeks. \u201cWith the economy continuing to grind more and more to a halt, it\u2019s clear the demand destruction is continuing to grow. Whatever efforts are being made to cut production in the U.S. and capital expenditures, it\u2019s not enough right now,\u201d said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. On Friday, Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell $1.49, or 5.2%, to settle at $26.98 a barrel. U.S. crude futures for April CLc1 fell $2.69, or 10.7%, to settle at $22.53 a barrel. The front-month contract expires on Friday. The more active U.S. crude contract for May CLc2 settled down $3.28, or 12.7%, at $22.63. U.S. crude has lost half its value in the past two weeks, and Brent has dropped about 40%, as the pandemic has cut demand at the same time as a collapse of coordinated output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producers including Russia.  U.S. officials scrambled to respond on Friday, saying they would send a U.S. Energy Department official to Saudi Arabia for several months to work on stabilizing energy markets. Also, a Texas state regulator spoke with OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo about the possibility of a global production cut. Texas regulators have not intervened to cut output among state producers since 1973. The American Petroleum Institute weighed in against the idea on Friday, saying quotas do not work. \u201cAs far as a coordinated response with OPEC, it\u2019s hard to see a plan coming together along those lines,\u201d Kilduff said. Prices dropped sharply just before Friday\u2019s close, as hedge funds and other money managers rushed to get out of the contract on its final day of trading, pushing the expiring April contract down by twice as much as the current May contract, said Bob Yawger, director of Energy Futures for Mizuho.  Saudi Arabia said it would push its production to a record 12.3 million bpd and booked shipments to send oil around the globe, refusing entreaties to rein in output. U.S. elected officials have urged the Trump Administration to get involved. Traders and analysts were scrambling to revise down forecasts for oil demand, as government lockdowns to contain the coronavirus outbreak have rapidly cut fuel consumption.  \u201cGlobal demand could easily drop by 10 million barrels per day or more,\u201d said Giovanni Serio, head of research at Vitol. Others, including IHS Markit and Standard Chartered bank, have made similar predictions.

U.N. chief Antonio Guterres warned that a global recession, \u201cperhaps of record dimensions\u201d, was a near certainty. \u201cThis is a moment that demands coordinated, decisive, and innovative policy action from the world\u2019s leading economies,\u201d Guterres told reporters via a video conference. \u201cWe are in an unprecedented situation and the normal rules no longer apply.\u201d Tourism and airlines have been particularly battered, as the world\u2019s citizens hunker down to minimize contact and curb the spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness. But few sectors have been spared by a crisis threatening a lengthy global recession. The United States is urging Americans not to travel abroad at all and could announce restrictions at the U.S.-Mexican border on Friday. They would be similar to the closure of the U.S.-Canada border to non-essential traffic. Markets have suffered routs unseen since the 2008 financial debacle, with investors rushing to the U.S. dollar as a safe haven. Wall Street tried to bounce back on Thursday. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX closed up 0.5%, still around 30% off highs reached last month. U.S. oil prices posted their largest one-day gain ever, rising 25%. [.N] [O/R] Policymakers in the United States, Europe and Asia have slashed interest rates and opened liquidity taps to try to stabilise economies hit by quarantined consumers, broken supply chains, disrupted transport and paralysed businesses. The virus, thought to have originated from wildlife in mainland China late last year, has jumped to 172 other nations and territories with more than 20,000 new cases reported in the past 24 hours - a new daily record. Cases in Germany, Iran and Spain rose to more than 12,000 each. An official in Tehran tweeted that the coronavirus was killing one person every 10 minutes.  Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 Britain, which has reported 144 deaths, was closing dozens of underground stations in London and ordering schools shut from Friday.  Some 20,000 soldiers were on standby, Queen Elizabeth headed for sanctuary in the ancient castle of Windsor, and the Tower of London was to close along with other historic buildings.  \u201cMany of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe,\u201d the 93-year-old monarch said in an address to the nation. \u201cI am certain we are up to that challenge,\u201d she added. Italian soldiers transported corpses overnight from an overwhelmed cemetery in Europe\u2019s worst-hit nation where 3,405 people have died, more than in mainland China. Germany\u2019s military was also preparing to help.  Supermarkets in many countries were besieged with shoppers stocking up on food staples and hygiene products. Some rationed sales and fixed special hours for the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable to severe illness.   Solidarity projects were springing up in some of the world\u2019s poorest corners. In Kenya\u2019s Kibera slum, volunteers with plastic drums of water and boxes of soap on motorbikes set up handwashing stations for people without clean water. Russia reported its first coronavirus death on Thursday. Amid the gloom, China provided a ray of hope as it reported zero new local transmissions of the virus, a sign of success for its draconian containment policies since January. Imported cases accounted for all 34 new infections in China. In the United States, where President Donald Trump had initially played down the coronavirus threat, infections surged with over 11,500 known cases and at least 186 deaths.  Trump has infuriated Beijing\u2019s Communist Party rulers by rebuking it for not acting faster and drawn accusations of racism by referring to COVID-19 as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d. \u201cWe continue our relentless effort to defeat the Chinese virus,\u201d he said in opening remarks at a briefing on Thursday. The head of the U.S. National Guard said tens of thousands of its troops could be activated to help U.S. states deal with the outbreak now in all 50 states.  In a bewildering raft of financial measures around the world, the European Central Bank launched new bond purchases worth 750 billion euros ($817 billion). That brought some relief to bond markets and also halted European shares\u2019 slide. The U.S. Federal Reserve rolled out its third emergency credit programme in two days, aimed at keeping the $3.8 trillion money market mutual fund industry functioning. The Bank of England cut interest rates to 0.1%, its second emergency rate cut in just over a week.  China was to unleash trillions of yuan of fiscal stimulus and South Korea pledged 50 trillion won ($39 billion). The desperate state of industry was writ large in Detroit, where the big three automakers - Ford Motor Co (F.N), General Motors Co (GM.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) - were shutting U.S. plants, as well as factories in Canada and Mexico. Some automakers have pledged to help manufacture much needed medical supplies. With some economists fearing prolonged pain akin to the 1930s Great Depression and others anticipating a bounceback, gloomy data and forecasts abounded.  In one of the most dire calls, J.P. Morgan economists forecast the Chinese economy to drop more than 40% this quarter and the U.S. economy to shrink 14% in the next. Ratings agency Moody\u2019s prepared for mass downgradings.  In Britain, small gin distilleries have started producing hand sanitizer amid a national shortage, a trend mirrored across the globe from Australia to the United States.

All 41 of the new confirmed cases in China were imported from overseas, the country\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday, bringing the total number of such cases to 269. There were no locally transmitted cases for the third consecutive day. Beijing and Shanghai were the main entry points for the returnees, many of whom are students studying abroad. They have come back after many campuses in the United States and Europe shut down to stem rapidly rising infection rates there.  Also returning in a flight to safety were China-based expats, as businesses begin to reopen. While there is no reported transmission of the virus from people arriving from abroad to local communities, authorities across China are tightening public health measures.  \u201cSince March 11, when the World Health Organization characterized the epidemic as a pandemic, the cumulative number of imported cases (in China) has risen from 85 to 269, up by 216% and outpacing the 98% increase in the cumulative worldwide confirmed cases during the same period,\u201d Mi Feng, spokesman of the National Health Commission, said at a regular press briefing. China must strictly prevent the import of the virus from overseas and a rebound in cases, Mi said. Of the 14 new imported cases in Beijing on Friday, five were Chinese students returning from abroad. Among Shanghai\u2019s record nine cases, five were students flying back from Britain, France and Switzerland. The southern provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the eastern provinces of Shandong and Zhejiang, as well as Shaanxi and Sichuan, all reported cases. Guangdong\u2019s health commission said on Saturday travelers who enter Guangdong province from abroad will be subject to a 14-day quarantine on arrival either in personal residences or at a centralized quarantine center at the expense of the traveler. Infected people have also entered China through the major transport hub of Shenzhen, including people making their way back to the mainland from Hong Kong by land.  While the influx of infections from overseas remains modest, they present a potential threat to Chinese authorities keen to restart factories and get consumers to spend again.  Analysts have slashed forecasts for China\u2019s first-quarter gross domestic product to levels not seen since the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, with all sectors of the economy hammered by the coronavirus outbreak this year. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China stood at 81,008 at the end of Friday, the health authority said. The death toll was 3,255, up by seven, a much slower rate than at the height of the crisis. The lack of locally transmitted cases for the third day running underscored a recovery that has prompted officials to relax restrictions, even in the virus epicenter of Wuhan. On Saturday, the official Xinhua news agency said commercial outlets in residential communities and villages without existing cases of virus can resume business, citing the municipal bureau of commerce. The first phase of a clinical trial of a vaccine has kicked off, state-backed Science and Technology Daily reported on Saturday.  The first batch of 36 volunteers, comprising Wuhan residents aged between 18 and 60, will undergo a 14-day quarantine at a centralized location.

Mainland China, where the coronavirus broke out late last year, reported zero locally transmitted cases of the disease for the third day running on Saturday. The pandemic has forced the shut down of most professional sport around the world. North America\u2019s National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended its season on March 12 after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the virus.   Around 40 American and other foreigners play in the 20-team CBA league and all will have to undergo 14 days of quarantine after their return to China.

Most larger Chinese firms have reopened and many local staff have returned to work but infections could rise again as national and international travel resumes, the officials said. Outbreaks in other countries and financial market gyrations could also make consumers and firms wary of Chinese goods, just as the economy is getting back to work, they said.  The coronavirus, which has infected 250,000 people and killed more than 10,000, has wreaked havoc on the global economy. In China, the slowdown in the first quarter will be significant, leaving a deep mark on the full year, the IMF said. \u201cWhat started as a series of sudden stops in economic activity, quickly cascaded through the economy and morphed into a full-blown shock simultaneously impeding supply and demand,\u201d the IMF blog said, citing very weak industrial production and retail sales data in January and February.  But it said China\u2019s response thus far showed that the right policies made a difference in fighting the disease and mitigating its impact, albeit with tough economic tradeoffs. Chinese policymakers needed to be ready to continue to support growth and financial stability, if necessary, and to coordinate internationally, the IMF said. Helge Berger, the IMF\u2019s China mission chief and lead author of the blog, said fiscal policy had an important role to play as Chinese authorities worked to mitigate economic shock and support the recovery. China is expected to unleash trillions of yuan of fiscal stimulus, backed by as much as 2.8 trillion yuan ($395 billion)in local government bonds, to revive its economy, four policy sources told Reuters on Thursday. \u201cWhile it is too early to speak about some of the proposals being discussed, it will be helpful to provide a mix of measures that is on-budget (and) well-targeted to help those most affected by the current crisis,\u201d Berger told Reuters. The blog said China\u2019s strict constraints on movement at the height of the outbreak had devastated Hubei province, where the virus originated, but clearly slowed the spread of the disease. It said Chinese policymakers acted quickly to help vulnerable households and small businesses, waiving social security fees, utility bills and channeling credit through fintech firms, as well as arranging subsidized credit to support scaling up production of medical equipment. In addition, authorities worked to incentivize banks to lend to smaller firms and cut reserve requirements, while continuing to lend generously to larger firms and state-owned enterprises.

The agreement follows a Phase 1 deal to end a prolonged trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies and highlights China\u2019s need for more imported meat as it battles a fatal pig disease. Beijing banned imports of U.S. poultry and eggs in January 2015 because of a U.S. outbreak of highly pathogenic, or virulent, avian flu, closing a market worth $500 million in 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. China lifted the ban in November 2019 as the countries sought to finalize the deal to ease their trade war, benefiting U.S. chicken companies like Tyson Foods (TSN.N) and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride (PPC.O). \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this,\u201d said Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, a trade group. \u201cIt gives everybody reassurance that we\u2019re not going to see a repeat of what happened in 2015.\u201d The USDA did not respond to requests for comment about the new agreement over avian flu. China, in the trade deal signed on Jan. 15, promised to buy at least an additional $12.5 billion worth of U.S. farm products in 2020 and at least $19.5 billion in 2021 over the 2017 level of $24 billion. The agreement over avian flu reflect Beijing\u2019s \u201cfriendly attitude\u201d toward imports, said Li Qiang, chief analyst with Shanghai-based JCI, a leading agriculture consultancy in China. \u201cIt shows that under the initial Sino-U.S. trade deal, China is trying its best to increase imports of U.S. agriculture products, on the precondition of guaranteeing prevention of the disease,\u201d Li said. Beijing also recently made U.S. poultry eligible for exemptions to retaliatory duties. If avian flu is found in the United States, China will restrict imports from the state where the case is detected, rather than the whole country, according to the export council. The suspension may be lifted if there are no new cases for three months following the disposal of the last case, the group said. There will be no trade restrictions for less-virulent cases of low pathogenic bird flu, according to the export council.

Fears of a second wave of infections are growing just as China brings its epidemic under control, with the spread of the virus in Europe and North America spurring a rush homewards by Chinese expatriates, many of them students. \u201cThe number of imported cases in China has further increased, and so the pressure to be on guard has also increased,\u201d Wang Bin, an official of the National Health Commission, told a news conference in Beijing on Friday. Mainland China had 39 new imported infections on Thursday, the commission said. Fourteen of these were in the southern province of Guangdong, eight in the commercial hub of Shanghai and six in the capital, Beijing, it said in a statement. The main entrypoints for infected travellers have been key transport hubs such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong, including the city of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong. A smattering of imported cases were also reported in the city of Tianjin and the provinces of Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shandong and Gansu in the north, as well as in the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Sichuan, and the region of Guangxi further south, taking China\u2019s total imported infections to 228. The commission did not say where the cases were believed to have originated, but provincial authorities said some of the travellers had been in Britain, Spain and the United States. \u201cEveryone is being very vigilant about those coming back from abroad. We must absolutely not let our guard down,\u201d Cao, a Beijing resident who gave only his surname, told Reuters.  \u201cWe cannot relax this vigilance so much that we see a rebound.\u201d  In Gansu, five officials were punished for picking up travellers returning from overseas without permission, including two who have tested positive, the official Xinhua news agency said. As concern grows over infected arrivals from overseas, the foreign ministers of China, Japan and South Korea held a video conference on Friday to discuss cooperation to rein in the pandemic. The new imported case in Tianjin, a city of 11 million, was a 23-year-old woman studying in London who came home via Zurich, Tokyo and Beijing, Xinhua said. The northeastern city of Shenyang said its first imported case was a traveller arriving from London via Seoul, who  displayed no fever or respiratory tract symptoms at the airport on March 16. Many outbreaks overseas were caused by travellers from China who were pre-symptomatic and so had not been screened or isolated, the Yale School of Public Health said in a study.    China has long recommended self-isolation by returning travellers, but authorities in some regions now enforce 14 days in quarantine in a medical facility for people returning from any of 24 badly-hit nations, to limit the risk of spread by those not yet showing symptoms.      For a second day, there were no new cases in the outbreak epicentre of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, the National Health Commission said.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, referring to the \u201cChinese virus\u201d - a term Trump has used repeatedly, greatly angering Beijing - told the same briefing of the U.S. coronavirus task force that Beijing\u2019s delay in sharing information about the virus had created risks to people worldwide. Trump said he has a very good relationship with Xi and considered him a friend, while adding: \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that this got out of control. It came from China, it got out of control. Some people are upset, I know. I know President Xi. He loves China. He respects the United States. And I have to say I respect China greatly and I respect President Xi.\u201d Pompeo, a persistent critic of China, said it was not a matter of apportioning blame, but the Chinese government was the first to know about the risk the virus presented and was slow to share vital information. \u201cWhen you see a delay in information flowing from the Chinese Communist Party to the technical people who we wanted to get into China immediately to assist in this, every moment of delay connected to being able to identify this risk, correct the risk factors, creates risks to people all around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why it\u2019s not about blaming someone for this, this is about moving forward to make sure that we continue to have the information we need to do our jobs.\u201d Trump ratcheted up his rhetoric against China over the coronavirus this week, saying Beijing should have acted sooner to warn the world and dismissing criticism that his labeling it the \u201cChinese virus\u201d was racist.  The president and his administration have angrily rejected attempts by Chinese officials to blame the virus on the U.S. military, but last week, Trump praised China\u2019s data sharing about the disease. The dispute over the coronavirus is just the latest irritant in relations between the world two largest economies, which are already strained over issues ranging from trade and intellectual property rights to press freedom.

Following a highly publicised hunt for supplies amid mounting criticism from local authorities and hospitals, government officials greeted a flight from Shanghai carrying 1.1 million FFP-2 level respirators at Prague\u2019s Vaclav Havel Airport. Respirators have been in acute demand in some hospitals, where even front-line staff didn\u2019t have sufficient supplies, news website http://www.novinky.cz reported earlier this week. The shipment is the first in a series of direct air deliveries from China which should continue over the next at least six weeks, Interior Minister Jan Hamacek said. The virus was first identified in December in the central Chinese province of Hubei.  \u201cThere are a number of flights ahead of us. We have built an air-bridge,\u201d Hamacek said at a televised news conference staged on tarmac in front of the plane. On Saturday, the world\u2019s biggest cargo plane, Antonov An-124, was expected to bring 100 tonnes of masks, respirators and other equipment, Hamacek said.  \u201cI am convinced that after Saturday, we will have the worst behind us in terms of protective gear, and that we have a system how to deliver them to the Czech Republic regularly,\u201d he said. The shipment has a political dimension. Hamacek thanked all involved, including China\u2019s ambassador who attended the arrival - a sign of improvement in relations between the two countries that turned sour in recent months despite the pro-China leanings of President Milos Zeman.  China\u2019s ambassador had faced sharp criticism from other Czech leaders for putting pressure on the country not to promote ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing considers sovereign territory. Opposition parties said that China was using the medical deliveries to improve its image. The government has ordered people to cover their mouths and noses in public as of Thursday. People have resorted to making masks at home because they are not available in stores or from the authorities.

As part of the interim Sino-U.S. trade deal signed in January, China will scrap foreign ownership caps in the mutual fund and brokerage industries on April 1.  The Shanghai government said foreign financial institutions are actively preparing to run wholly-owned businesses in Shanghai.

Net profit came in at 6.095 billion yuan ($862 million) last year, versus 5.407 billion yuan in 2018, the company said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing, warning the coronavirus will have a \u201cprofound impact\u201d on global supply chains. The rise in profit came even as Hongqiao saw an 11.3% fall in production of aluminum alloy products to 5.644 million tonnes, and a 6.7% drop in revenue to 84.18 billion yuan last year as Shanghai aluminum prices averaged 2.4% lower.  The company attributed the higher profit to lower purchase prices for raw materials such as coal, higher efficiency and greater sales of fabricated aluminum products.     It said lower primary aluminum production was due to China\u2019s winter restrictions on industrial output in 2019, as well as its switch to more advanced facilities and an outage caused by flooding near its Shandong headquarters in August. Hongqiao had said at the time its annual production would fall by 200,000-300,000 tonnes as a result of that incident. The company is moving around 2 million tonnes of annual aluminum production from Shandong to Southwest China\u2019s Yunnan province to take advantage of cleaner hydropower, but doing so will not increase its licensed capacity of 6.5 million tonnes per year of primary aluminum. However, Hongqiao said it would \u201cdedicate itself to increasing the primary aluminum production capacity through secondary aluminum,\u201d or scrap aluminum, and \u201cplans to add new production lines for secondary aluminum,\u201d without elaborating.     The company currently makes its aluminum using alumina, a substance refined from bauxite ore, but recycling scrap aluminum - such as used cans - could help it save costs, especially with Shanghai aluminum prices falling to their lowest since 2016 this week. \u201cIt is expected that the aluminum industry will face greater challenges and opportunities\u201d in 2020 due to the epidemic, Hongqiao added. Alumina sales rose 29% in 2019 to 5.28 million tonnes after the company \u201cseized market opportunities\u201d to sell more material domestically when its own usage decreased, Hongqiao said, adding that the 1 million tonnes per year second phase of its alumina project in Indonesia is expected to start up the end of 2020.

[L4N2BC3SC] The number of cases in Japan has been far smaller, but Tokyo has the extra worry of whether to press ahead with hosting the Olympics this summer.  Japan was given expressions of support for hosting the Olympics during the video-conference call between the minister, according to South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry. The government remains committed to holding Games as planned in July, despite expectations that some 600,000 spectators and athletes would descend on Tokyo. Japan has had 963 domestically transmitted cases and 33 deaths, according to public broadcaster NHK. That does not include more than 700 cases and seven deaths from a cruise ship moored near Tokyo last month.  TWO-WEEK QUARANTINE During their call, the ministers shared information on the outbreaks in their countries. \u201cI think the three countries need to work together to contain the spread of the coronavirus and minimize any resulting reduction on exchanges and cooperation between the peoples, as well as its economic and social impact,\u201d South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said at the outset of the call. South Korea\u2019s government said on Tuesday it will conduct a coronavirus check on all travelers from Europe and impose a two-week mandatory quarantine, starting Sunday, for those who intend staying long term. \u201cThis is the toughest step we could take without banning entries from Europe, where the virus is spreading at an unexpected speed,\u201d Yoon Tae-ho, director-general for public health policy at the health ministry, told a briefing.  \u201cWe\u2019re also closely monitoring developments in the United States where the rate of the transmission has been increasing over the last few days.\u201d The move came a day after tighter border checks took effect for all people arriving from overseas. South Korea has established special entry procedures for visitors from hard-hit countries like China, Italy and Iran, requiring them to sign up by a smartphone application to track whether they have any symptoms such as fever. Despite strong diplomatic and economic ties between the three North Asian neighbors, historic grievances dog their relations. And reduced flights, stronger border controls, and quarantine requirements introduced in response to the epidemic have proved irksome. Earlier this month, Seoul suspended visas and visa waivers for Japan in a tit-for-tat move following Tokyo\u2019s own travel restrictions on Koreans, triggering fears that their defenses against the virus could spark a fresh feud. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 87 new coronavirus cases on Friday, bringing the total national infections to 8,652.  As of Thursday, there were 79 cases involving infected people who had recently arrived in the country, up from 44 on Sunday. Most of them were South Koreans, 27 came from Europe, 16 from China, and 12 from other Asian countries, according to the KCDC. The daily tally for new infections has been trending downward over the past week, despite a slight uptick on Thursday as small-scale outbreaks continued to emerge across the country. South Korea\u2019s death toll rose to 101, from 94.

With over 242,000 infections and nearly 10,000 deaths, the epidemic has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with painful periods such as World War Two, the 2008 financial crisis and the 1918 Spanish flu. U.N. chief Antonio Guterres warned that a global recession, \u201cperhaps of record dimensions\u201d, was a near certainty. \u201cThis is a moment that demands coordinated, decisive, and innovative policy action from the world\u2019s leading economies,\u201d Guterres told reporters via a video conference. \u201cWe are in an unprecedented situation and the normal rules no longer apply.\u201d Tourism and airlines have been particularly battered, as the world\u2019s citizens hunker down to minimize contact and curb the spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness. But few sectors have been spared by a crisis threatening a lengthy global recession. The United States is urging Americans not to travel abroad at all and could announce restrictions at the U.S.-Mexican border on Friday. They would be similar to the closure of the U.S.-Canada border to non-essential traffic. Markets have suffered routs unseen since the 2008 financial debacle, with investors rushing to the U.S. dollar as a safe haven. Wall Street tried to bounce back on Thursday. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX closed up 0.5%, still around 30% off highs reached last month. U.S. oil prices posted their largest one-day gain ever, rising 25%.

The virus, thought to have originated from wildlife in mainland China late last year, has jumped to 172 other nations and territories with more than 20,000 new cases reported in the past 24 hours - a new daily record. Cases in Germany, Iran and Spain rose to more than 12,000 each. An official in Tehran tweeted that the coronavirus was killing one person every 10 minutes.  Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 Britain, which has reported 144 deaths, was closing dozens of underground stations in London and ordering schools shut from Friday.  Some 20,000 soldiers were on standby, Queen Elizabeth headed for sanctuary in the ancient castle of Windsor, and the Tower of London was to close along with other historic buildings.  \u201cMany of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe,\u201d the 93-year-old monarch said in an address to the nation. \u201cI am certain we are up to that challenge,\u201d she added. Italian soldiers transported corpses overnight from an overwhelmed cemetery in Europe\u2019s worst-hit nation where 3,405 people have died, more than in mainland China. Germany\u2019s military was also preparing to help.  Supermarkets in many countries were besieged with shoppers stocking up on food staples and hygiene products. Some rationed sales and fixed special hours for the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable to severe illness.   Solidarity projects were springing up in some of the world\u2019s poorest corners. In Kenya\u2019s Kibera slum, volunteers with plastic drums of water and boxes of soap on motorbikes set up handwashing stations for people without clean water. Russia reported its first coronavirus death on Thursday. Amid the gloom, China provided a ray of hope as it reported zero new local transmissions of the virus, a sign of success for its draconian containment policies since January. Imported cases accounted for all 34 new infections in China. In the United States, where President Donald Trump had initially played down the coronavirus threat, infections surged with over 11,500 known cases and at least 186 deaths.  Trump has infuriated Beijing\u2019s Communist Party rulers by rebuking it for not acting faster and drawn accusations of racism by referring to COVID-19 as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d. \u201cWe continue our relentless effort to defeat the Chinese virus,\u201d he said in opening remarks at a briefing on Thursday.

In a bewildering raft of financial measures around the world, the European Central Bank launched new bond purchases worth 750 billion euros ($817 billion). That brought some relief to bond markets and also halted European shares\u2019 slide. The U.S. Federal Reserve rolled out its third emergency credit programme in two days, aimed at keeping the $3.8 trillion money market mutual fund industry functioning. The Bank of England cut interest rates to 0.1%, its second emergency rate cut in just over a week.  China was to unleash trillions of yuan of fiscal stimulus and South Korea pledged 50 trillion won ($39 billion). The desperate state of industry was writ large in Detroit, where the big three automakers - Ford Motor Co (F.N), General Motors Co (GM.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) - were shutting U.S. plants, as well as factories in Canada and Mexico.

All 41 of the new confirmed cases in China were imported from overseas, the country\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday, bringing the total number of such cases to 269. There were no locally transmitted cases for the third consecutive day. Beijing and Shanghai were the main entry points for the returnees, many of whom are students studying abroad. They have come back after many campuses in the United States and Europe shut down to stem rapidly rising infection rates there.  Also returning in a flight to safety were China-based expats, as businesses begin to reopen. While there is no reported transmission of the virus from people arriving from abroad to local communities, authorities across China are tightening public health measures.  \u201cSince March 11, when the World Health Organization characterized the epidemic as a pandemic, the cumulative number of imported cases (in China) has risen from 85 to 269, up by 216% and outpacing the 98% increase in the cumulative worldwide confirmed cases during the same period,\u201d Mi Feng, spokesman of the National Health Commission, said at a regular press briefing. China must strictly prevent the import of the virus from overseas and a rebound in cases, Mi said. Of the 14 new imported cases in Beijing on Friday, five were Chinese students returning from abroad. Among Shanghai\u2019s record nine cases, five were students flying back from Britain, France and Switzerland. The southern provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the eastern provinces of Shandong and Zhejiang, as well as Shaanxi and Sichuan, all reported cases. Guangdong\u2019s health commission said on Saturday travelers who enter Guangdong province from abroad will be subject to a 14-day quarantine on arrival either in personal residences or at a centralized quarantine center at the expense of the traveler. Infected people have also entered China through the major transport hub of Shenzhen, including people making their way back to the mainland from Hong Kong by land.  While the influx of infections from overseas remains modest, they present a potential threat to Chinese authorities keen to restart factories and get consumers to spend again.  Analysts have slashed forecasts for China\u2019s first-quarter gross domestic product to levels not seen since the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, with all sectors of the economy hammered by the coronavirus outbreak this year. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China stood at 81,008 at the end of Friday, the health authority said. The death toll was 3,255, up by seven, a much slower rate than at the height of the crisis. The lack of locally transmitted cases for the third day running underscored a recovery that has prompted officials to relax restrictions, even in the virus epicenter of Wuhan. On Saturday, the official Xinhua news agency said commercial outlets in residential communities and villages without existing cases of virus can resume business, citing the municipal bureau of commerce. The first phase of a clinical trial of a vaccine has kicked off, state-backed Science and Technology Daily reported on Saturday.  The first batch of 36 volunteers, comprising Wuhan residents aged between 18 and 60, will undergo a 14-day quarantine at a centralized location.

Mainland China, where the coronavirus broke out late last year, reported zero locally transmitted cases of the disease for the third day running on Saturday. The pandemic has forced the shut down of most professional sport around the world. North America\u2019s National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended its season on March 12 after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the virus.

Most larger Chinese firms have reopened and many local staff have returned to work but infections could rise again as national and international travel resumes, the officials said. Outbreaks in other countries and financial market gyrations could also make consumers and firms wary of Chinese goods, just as the economy is getting back to work, they said.  The coronavirus, which has infected 250,000 people and killed more than 10,000, has wreaked havoc on the global economy. In China, the slowdown in the first quarter will be significant, leaving a deep mark on the full year, the IMF said. \u201cWhat started as a series of sudden stops in economic activity, quickly cascaded through the economy and morphed into a full-blown shock simultaneously impeding supply and demand,\u201d the IMF blog said, citing very weak industrial production and retail sales data in January and February.  But it said China\u2019s response thus far showed that the right policies made a difference in fighting the disease and mitigating its impact, albeit with tough economic tradeoffs. Chinese policymakers needed to be ready to continue to support growth and financial stability, if necessary, and to coordinate internationally, the IMF said. Helge Berger, the IMF\u2019s China mission chief and lead author of the blog, said fiscal policy had an important role to play as Chinese authorities worked to mitigate economic shock and support the recovery. China is expected to unleash trillions of yuan of fiscal stimulus, backed by as much as 2.8 trillion yuan ($395 billion)in local government bonds, to revive its economy, four policy sources told Reuters on Thursday. \u201cWhile it is too early to speak about some of the proposals being discussed, it will be helpful to provide a mix of measures that is on-budget (and) well-targeted to help those most affected by the current crisis,\u201d Berger told Reuters. The blog said China\u2019s strict constraints on movement at the height of the outbreak had devastated Hubei province, where the virus originated, but clearly slowed the spread of the disease. It said Chinese policymakers acted quickly to help vulnerable households and small businesses, waiving social security fees, utility bills and channeling credit through fintech firms, as well as arranging subsidized credit to support scaling up production of medical equipment. In addition, authorities worked to incentivize banks to lend to smaller firms and cut reserve requirements, while continuing to lend generously to larger firms and state-owned enterprises.

The agreement follows a Phase 1 deal to end a prolonged trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies and highlights China\u2019s need for more imported meat as it battles a fatal pig disease. Beijing banned imports of U.S. poultry and eggs in January 2015 because of a U.S. outbreak of highly pathogenic, or virulent, avian flu, closing a market worth $500 million in 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. China lifted the ban in November 2019 as the countries sought to finalize the deal to ease their trade war, benefiting U.S. chicken companies like Tyson Foods (TSN.N) and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride (PPC.O). \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this,\u201d said Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, a trade group. \u201cIt gives everybody reassurance that we\u2019re not going to see a repeat of what happened in 2015.\u201d The USDA did not respond to requests for comment about the new agreement over avian flu. China, in the trade deal signed on Jan. 15, promised to buy at least an additional $12.5 billion worth of U.S. farm products in 2020 and at least $19.5 billion in 2021 over the 2017 level of $24 billion. The agreement over avian flu reflect Beijing\u2019s \u201cfriendly attitude\u201d toward imports, said Li Qiang, chief analyst with Shanghai-based JCI, a leading agriculture consultancy in China. \u201cIt shows that under the initial Sino-U.S. trade deal, China is trying its best to increase imports of U.S. agriculture products, on the precondition of guaranteeing prevention of the disease,\u201d Li said. Beijing also recently made U.S. poultry eligible for exemptions to retaliatory duties. If avian flu is found in the United States, China will restrict imports from the state where the case is detected, rather than the whole country, according to the export council. The suspension may be lifted if there are no new cases for three months following the disposal of the last case, the group said. There will be no trade restrictions for less-virulent cases of low pathogenic bird flu, according to the export council.

Fears of a second wave of infections are growing just as China brings its epidemic under control, with the spread of the virus in Europe and North America spurring a rush homewards by Chinese expatriates, many of them students. \u201cThe number of imported cases in China has further increased, and so the pressure to be on guard has also increased,\u201d Wang Bin, an official of the National Health Commission, told a news conference in Beijing on Friday. Mainland China had 39 new imported infections on Thursday, the commission said. Fourteen of these were in the southern province of Guangdong, eight in the commercial hub of Shanghai and six in the capital, Beijing, it said in a statement. The main entrypoints for infected travellers have been key transport hubs such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong, including the city of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong. A smattering of imported cases were also reported in the city of Tianjin and the provinces of Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shandong and Gansu in the north, as well as in the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Sichuan, and the region of Guangxi further south, taking China\u2019s total imported infections to 228. The commission did not say where the cases were believed to have originated, but provincial authorities said some of the travellers had been in Britain, Spain and the United States. \u201cEveryone is being very vigilant about those coming back from abroad. We must absolutely not let our guard down,\u201d Cao, a Beijing resident who gave only his surname, told Reuters.  \u201cWe cannot relax this vigilance so much that we see a rebound.\u201d  In Gansu, five officials were punished for picking up travellers returning from overseas without permission, including two who have tested positive, the official Xinhua news agency said. As concern grows over infected arrivals from overseas, the foreign ministers of China, Japan and South Korea held a video conference on Friday to discuss cooperation to rein in the pandemic. The new imported case in Tianjin, a city of 11 million, was a 23-year-old woman studying in London who came home via Zurich, Tokyo and Beijing, Xinhua said. The northeastern city of Shenyang said its first imported case was a traveller arriving from London via Seoul, who  displayed no fever or respiratory tract symptoms at the airport on March 16. Many outbreaks overseas were caused by travellers from China who were pre-symptomatic and so had not been screened or isolated, the Yale School of Public Health said in a study.    China has long recommended self-isolation by returning travellers, but authorities in some regions now enforce 14 days in quarantine in a medical facility for people returning from any of 24 badly-hit nations, to limit the risk of spread by those not yet showing symptoms.      For a second day, there were no new cases in the outbreak epicentre of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, the National Health Commission said. Mainland China\u2019s tally of infections stands at 80,967, with the death toll at 3,248 by Thursday, an increase of three from the previous day.

Respirators have been in acute demand in some hospitals, where even front-line staff didn\u2019t have sufficient supplies, news website http://www.novinky.cz reported earlier this week. The shipment is the first in a series of direct air deliveries from China which should continue over the next at least six weeks, Interior Minister Jan Hamacek said.

The shipment has a political dimension. Hamacek thanked all involved, including China\u2019s ambassador who attended the arrival - a sign of improvement in relations between the two countries that turned sour in recent months despite the pro-China leanings of President Milos Zeman.  China\u2019s ambassador had faced sharp criticism from other Czech leaders for putting pressure on the country not to promote ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing considers sovereign territory. Opposition parties said that China was using the medical deliveries to improve its image. The government has ordered people to cover their mouths and noses in public as of Thursday. People have resorted to making masks at home because they are not available in stores or from the authorities.

Shanghai also held an online opening ceremony for local branches of five global institutions including JPMorgan, Invesco and Russell Investment. \u201cIn such a special situation where the city is making all efforts to combat the coronavirus, the ceremony shows the world Shanghai\u2019s determination to further open its financial industry,\u201d the Shanghai Municipal Office of Finance Service said in a statement.  It also shows global financial institutions have confidence in Shanghai, it said. As the virus spreads globally, Shanghai has stepped up screening of inbound travelers to prevent them importing new cases, raising concerns the pace of China\u2019s financial liberalization could be slowed.  As part of the interim Sino-U.S. trade deal signed in January, China will scrap foreign ownership caps in the mutual fund and brokerage industries on April 1.  The Shanghai government said foreign financial institutions are actively preparing to run wholly-owned businesses in Shanghai. Global asset managers, including BlackRock (BLK.N), Fidelity International, Neuberger Berman and Schroders (SDR.L) plan to set up mutual fund units in Shanghai and will submit applications once rules allow, the statement said.  In the brokerage sector, the Singaporean bank DBS (DBSM.SI) has applied to set up a majority-owned securities venture in the city, while Morgan Stanley (MS.N) plans to raise its stake in its Chinese brokerage venture to 51% from 49% now.  In addition, several financial institutions plan to set up wholly-owned brokerage units in Shanghai as soon as ownership restrictions are scrapped. \u201cChina represents one of the largest opportunities for many of our clients and is a critical component of JPMorgan\u2019s growth plans in Asia Pacific, and globally,\u201d Filippo Gori, CEO for JPMorgan, Asia Pacific, said in a separate statement announcing the opening of its majority-owned Chinese brokerage venture.

Net profit came in at 6.095 billion yuan ($862 million) last year, versus 5.407 billion yuan in 2018, the company said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing, warning the coronavirus will have a \u201cprofound impact\u201d on global supply chains. The rise in profit came even as Hongqiao saw an 11.3% fall in production of aluminum alloy products to 5.644 million tonnes, and a 6.7% drop in revenue to 84.18 billion yuan last year as Shanghai aluminum prices averaged 2.4% lower.  The company attributed the higher profit to lower purchase prices for raw materials such as coal, higher efficiency and greater sales of fabricated aluminum products.     It said lower primary aluminum production was due to China\u2019s winter restrictions on industrial output in 2019, as well as its switch to more advanced facilities and an outage caused by flooding near its Shandong headquarters in August. Hongqiao had said at the time its annual production would fall by 200,000-300,000 tonnes as a result of that incident. The company is moving around 2 million tonnes of annual aluminum production from Shandong to Southwest China\u2019s Yunnan province to take advantage of cleaner hydropower, but doing so will not increase its licensed capacity of 6.5 million tonnes per year of primary aluminum. However, Hongqiao said it would \u201cdedicate itself to increasing the primary aluminum production capacity through secondary aluminum,\u201d or scrap aluminum, and \u201cplans to add new production lines for secondary aluminum,\u201d without elaborating.     The company currently makes its aluminum using alumina, a substance refined from bauxite ore, but recycling scrap aluminum - such as used cans - could help it save costs, especially with Shanghai aluminum prices falling to their lowest since 2016 this week. \u201cIt is expected that the aluminum industry will face greater challenges and opportunities\u201d in 2020 due to the epidemic, Hongqiao added. Alumina sales rose 29% in 2019 to 5.28 million tonnes after the company \u201cseized market opportunities\u201d to sell more material domestically when its own usage decreased, Hongqiao said, adding that the 1 million tonnes per year second phase of its alumina project in Indonesia is expected to start up the end of 2020.

Though the epidemic erupted in China in December, and South Korea at one stage had the second-most infections, both subsequently succeeded in stifling domestic transmission of the virus. [L4N2BC3SC] The number of cases in Japan has been far smaller, but Tokyo has the extra worry of whether to press ahead with hosting the Olympics this summer.  Japan was given expressions of support for hosting the Olympics during the video-conference call between the minister, according to South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry. The government remains committed to holding Games as planned in July, despite expectations that some 600,000 spectators and athletes would descend on Tokyo. Japan has had 963 domestically transmitted cases and 33 deaths, according to public broadcaster NHK. That does not include more than 700 cases and seven deaths from a cruise ship moored near Tokyo last month.  TWO-WEEK QUARANTINE During their call, the ministers shared information on the outbreaks in their countries. \u201cI think the three countries need to work together to contain the spread of the coronavirus and minimize any resulting reduction on exchanges and cooperation between the peoples, as well as its economic and social impact,\u201d South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said at the outset of the call. South Korea\u2019s government said on Tuesday it will conduct a coronavirus check on all travelers from Europe and impose a two-week mandatory quarantine, starting Sunday, for those who intend staying long term. \u201cThis is the toughest step we could take without banning entries from Europe, where the virus is spreading at an unexpected speed,\u201d Yoon Tae-ho, director-general for public health policy at the health ministry, told a briefing.  \u201cWe\u2019re also closely monitoring developments in the United States where the rate of the transmission has been increasing over the last few days.\u201d The move came a day after tighter border checks took effect for all people arriving from overseas. South Korea has established special entry procedures for visitors from hard-hit countries like China, Italy and Iran, requiring them to sign up by a smartphone application to track whether they have any symptoms such as fever. Despite strong diplomatic and economic ties between the three North Asian neighbors, historic grievances dog their relations. And reduced flights, stronger border controls, and quarantine requirements introduced in response to the epidemic have proved irksome. Earlier this month, Seoul suspended visas and visa waivers for Japan in a tit-for-tat move following Tokyo\u2019s own travel restrictions on Koreans, triggering fears that their defenses against the virus could spark a fresh feud. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 87 new coronavirus cases on Friday, bringing the total national infections to 8,652.  As of Thursday, there were 79 cases involving infected people who had recently arrived in the country, up from 44 on Sunday. Most of them were South Koreans, 27 came from Europe, 16 from China, and 12 from other Asian countries, according to the KCDC. The daily tally for new infections has been trending downward over the past week, despite a slight uptick on Thursday as small-scale outbreaks continued to emerge across the country. South Korea\u2019s death toll rose to 101, from 94. South Korea\u2019s election commission said on Friday it will disinfect all polling stations and carry out checks on voters when they show up to cast their ballots in the April 15 parliamentary election.

Hundreds of police were deployed outside the jail to control a crowd that waited to celebrate the execution. Some held placards that read \u201cJustice for women\u201d and \u201cHang the culprits\u201d. The crime, which happened on the night of December 16, 2012, sparked massive protests and global outrage. The victim was dubbed Nirbhaya - the fearless one - by the Indian press, as she could not be named under Indian law. \u201cToday, justice has been done after seven years,\u201d the victim\u2019s mother told reporters outside the prison. \u201cI salute Indian judiciary and thank god for hearing our prayers...my daughter\u2019s soul can now rest in peace.\u201d  Six men were arrested for the brutal attack. One suspect, Ram Singh, was found dead in his jail cell in March 2013, having apparently taken his own life. Another, who was aged 17 at the time, was released in 2015 after serving three years in a reform facility - the maximum term possible for a juvenile in India. The four hanged on Friday were gym instructor Vinay Sharma, bus cleaner Akshay  Thakur, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta and unemployed Mukesh Singh, who were all sentenced to death by a fast-track court in 2013. In 2017, the Supreme Court upheld death sentences against four men, with judges ruling the crime met the \u201crarest of the rare\u201d standard required to justify capital punishment in India.\u00a0  India\u2019s president rejected pleas for clemency from the condemned men, after the Supreme Court dismissed their pleas for a review of the death sentences.

She died in a hospital in Singapore, where she had been transferred in a desperate attempt to save her.   Outrage over her death led to India passing tough new laws against sexual violence, including the death penalty for rape in some cases. Still, one woman reported a rape every 15 minutes on average in India in 2018, according to government data released last month, underlining the country\u2019s reputation as one of the worst places in the world to be female. Women reported almost 34,000 rapes in 2018, barely changed from the year before. Just over 85% led to charges, and 27% to convictions, according to the annual crime report released by the federal home ministry. Activists say the government statistics understate the number of rapes as it is still considered a taboo by conservative Indians to report sexual violence.

The telecom companies must pay billions in outstanding levies, penalties and interest following a 2019 Supreme Court order, putting industry giant Vodafone Idea - which owes some $4 billion - on the brink of collapse. Seeking to avoid such a disruptive outcome, the government this week petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the companies to pay the money over 20 years. But on Wednesday, the Save Consumer Rights Foundation said it opposed the government\u2019s move. \u201cNo other arrangement ought to be allowed apart from what the Court has passed as orders,\u201d Sriram Parakkat, the group\u2019s Supreme Court lawyer, told Reuters.  The top court is due to hear the matter again in two weeks. The foundation originally lodged a petition in January, arguing the government was in contempt of the court because it had instructed officials not to take coercive action against telecoms firms to demand payment. Vodafone Idea and rival Bharti Airtel have been discussing a flexible payment schedule with the government, according to several sources. Meanwhile, carrier Jio, backed by India\u2019s richest man Mukesh Ambani, has paid its roughly $27 million in dues. The Supreme Court heard the foundation\u2019s petition on Feb. 14, according to a court schedule, and Justice Arun Mishra then threatened officials with contempt proceedings, prompting the government at that time to demand \u201cimmediate\u201d payment.  Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel declined to comment.  The foundation was set up in 2018 by Anoop Nair, who has worked in banking in the Middle East and now runs his own risk assessment business in New Delhi.  Nair told Reuters it decided to act out of fear the government might be deprived of revenue.  \u201cWe had a meeting where we decided that this public money should not be thrown away,\u201d he said in an interview.

As India pushes ahead with its plan to turn 100 urban centres into smart cities, local governments are using technology like GPS watches to provide data they can use to improve efficiency and tighten budgets.  But city employees, campaigners and technology experts have raised concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of that data, as well as the susceptibility of the watches to failure like weak GPS signal or the devices switching off.  For three months Sharma and his colleagues from various departments like horticulture, sanitation and health have been gathering to demand that officials in Chandigarh, hailed as one of India\u2019s cleanest cities, stop using the GPS watches. They are among a growing number of municipal workers in a dozen cities across India who are protesting the linking of surveillance data to performance and salaries. Under the project, which launched in Chandigarh in February, workers are mandated to wear the GPS watches during their working hours. The watches feed a stream of data to a central control room, where officials monitor the movements of each employee.  If workers remove their watches, they are penalised, although there is no comprehensive data available on how many workers have been fined so far, or by how much. \u201cThe efficiency trackers seem like an over-reach,\u201d said Nandini Chami, deputy director at IT for Change, a Bangalore-based non-profit. \u201cGiven the nature of the employer-employee relationship, it is essential to know what are the boundaries of this surveillance and what will be a worker\u2019s right to appeal any data they want to contest,\u201d she said.

Yadav, Chandigarh\u2019s top civic official, said in a phone interview that the programme is about improving efficiency.  \u201cThis is an efficient way to check if our workers are on the ground doing their jobs,\u201d added Yadav, who said he also wears a watch, to set an example.  \u201cTheir salaries will be linked to this tracker and all the data will be put in the public domain eventually for increasing accountability.\u201d Yadav noted that there is no expectation of privacy for government employees while they are at work and that complaints and appeals would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  Suresh Kumar Sharma has been driving a sewer-cleaning machine for over two decades, unclogging street drains throughout Chandigarh. He said he has raised questions with his supervisors and other senior officials as he tries to understand the need for GPS surveillance. \u201cSometimes we receive five complaints (of blocked drains) in a day, but are able to attend to only one because cleaning blocked drains takes time,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cThe GPS tracker is going to reflect that I was only at one place and did not attend to the other four complaints. It will indicate that I did not complete my job and that will reflect in a pay cut. How is that okay?\u201d  Sharma said officials have reassured workers that there will be a complaint mechanism in place, though no details were provided.  Despite concerns from rights groups and protests from workers, the efficiency tracker project has been rolled out across India since 2017.  The initiative has been praised by civic bodies aiming to both make their cities smarter and meet the goals of the Clean India campaign launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. \u201cIt is the need of the hour,\u201d said Sumedha Kataria, municipal commissioner for Panchkula city in Haryana state. About 950 city employees in Panchkula have been wearing the watches since the programme started there last year, said Kataria. \u201cThere are targets to be met for the Swachh Bharat (Clean India) mission. Also, if we are vying to be a smart city then digital intervention is important for us to achieve our targets. It is the smart thing to do,\u201d she said in a phone interview.  Without a comprehensive data privacy law in India, the personal information of the country\u2019s 1.3 billion citizens is openly available, with no regulation over its use or protection for its users, digital rights campaigners say.  The Personal Data Protection Bill, which is pending parliament approval, will create a framework for data protection dictating what kind of data can be collected, and how it is collected, processed and stored. The bill also introduces hefty penalties for the misuse of that data. But the draft bill has met with opposition from various groups, including human rights organisations, for not meeting global privacy standards. Chami at IT for Change noted that the GPS watches for municipal workers are constantly collecting potentially sensitive data, including personal information and behavioural patterns. \u201cWithout mechanisms to allow the worker to audit his or her tracker data ... and appeal (or) contest errors stemming from remote tracker malfunction, workers\u2019 rights will be squelched,\u201d she said.  Nagpur city, in the western state of Maharashtra, has had more than 7,000 workers under watch since 2017. Pradeep Dasarwar, the health officer in charge of the project in Nagpur, said that since the project started, absenteeism has dropped by half, from 15% to 7%, and that wages were being cut for contract workers. Around the city, areas have been virtually fenced off, with street names and localities that have been earmarked for each worker fed into their GPS watches, Dasarwar explained. Unlike before, when workers marked their own attendance at the start and end of the day, the GPS watch project tracks their whereabouts automatically, making a note each time they leave their designated work area, he said. The watches provide data on how many hours they spend at work, how many breaks they take, and the number of work orders they respond to. \u201cIn the cases where (workers) are not doing their job properly, salary cuts have been initiated and we have data to show for it,\u201d Dasarwar said, over the phone. But Sharma, the gardener, does not see the watches as the key to efficiency. To him, they are a digital tool to \u201cthreaten\u201d and exploit workers. \u201cAt the end of the day, we don\u2019t know how they will use this data. Wage cuts are just the beginning.\u201d  Reporting by Anuradha Nagaraj @AnuraNagaraj; Editing by Jumana Farouky and Zoe Tabary.

Global oil prices have fallen around 40% in March as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has destroyed demand, while supplies are growing following Moscow\u2019s refusal to back deeper output cuts at a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its OPEC+ allies.  Leading OPEC producers Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi have said they will increase output while cutting prices, giving big consumers the chance to fill up at discounted prices. \u201cIt is an opportune time for us and for them (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and Saudi Aramco) to finalize the deals and fill the SPRs...If there is any delay, we might fill the SPRs on our own,\u201d said an official familiar with the matter, asking not to be named. A second source, who also requested anonymity, said the oil ministry has written to the finance ministry to release about 48-to-50 billion rupees ($673.7 million) to buy oil in 8-9 very large crude carriers for filling the storage. Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL) and India\u2019s oil and finance ministry had no immediate comment, while ADNOC and Saudi Aramco declined to comment. India, the world\u2019s third biggest oil importer and consumer,  imports about 80% of its oil needs and has built strategic storage at three locations in southern India to store up to 36.87 million barrels of oil or about 5 million tonnes to protect against supply disruption. ISPRL, a company charged with building of strategic storage, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the UAE\u2019s national oil company ADNOC for the lease of half of its 2.5 million tonnes Padur facility.  Last year it signed an MoU with Saudi Aramco for the lease of a quarter of Padur SPR. The leases allow the national oil companies to store their oil, some of which will cater for India\u2019s strategic needs, while they can sell the rest to Indian refiners. Padur has four compartments that hold about 4.6 million barrels each. The ISPRL has received 1 VLCC with Arab Mix to fill one compartment and will get a second VLCC in April, a third source said. The ISPRL has already leased half of the 1.5 million tonnes capacity in Mangalore storage to ADNOC, which has stored about 5.5 million barrels of Das oil in the cavern, while ISPRL has retained the remainder. \u201cThis is the right time to fill the SPRs before prices start moving up,\u201d a third source said. India has also filled its 1.03 million tonnes Vizag facility with Basra oil from another OPEC producer Iraq. While India is primarily taking advantage of low prices as a consumer nation, U.S. President Donald Trump aimed to help U.S. energy producers struggling to cope with the price fall by announcing he would take advantage of low prices to fill up the nation\u2019s emergency reserve.

But the riots that raged through the district last month appear to have cleaved lasting divisions in the community, reflecting a nationwide trend as tensions over the Hindu nationalist agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi boil over. Many Hindus in Yamuna Vihar, a sprawl of residential blocks and shops dotted with mosques and Hindu temples, and in other riot-hit districts of northeast Delhi, say they are boycotting merchants and refusing to hire workers from the Muslim community. Muslims say they are scrambling to find jobs at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has heightened pressure on India\u2019s economy. \u201cI have decided to never work with Muslims,\u201d said Yash Dhingra, who has a shop selling paint and bathroom fittings in Yamuna Vihar. \u201cI have identified new workers, they are Hindus,\u201d he said, standing in a narrow lane that was the scene of violent clashes in the riots that erupted on Feb. 23.  The trigger for the riots, the worst sectarian violence in the Indian capital in decades, was a citizenship law introduced last year that critics say marginalizes India\u2019s Muslim minority. Police records show at least 53 people, mostly Muslims, were killed and more than 200 were injured. Dhingra said the unrest had forever changed Yamuna Vihar. Gutted homes with broken doors can be seen across the neighborhood; electricity cables melted in the fires dangle dangerously above alleys strewn with stones and bricks used as makeshift weapons in the riots.  Most Hindu residents in the district are now boycotting Muslim workers, affecting everyone from cooks and cleaners to mechanics and fruit sellers, he said. \u201cWe have proof to show that Muslims started the violence, and now they are blaming it on us,\u201d Dhingra said. \u201cThis is their pattern as they are criminal-minded people.\u201d Those views were widely echoed in interviews with 25 Hindus in eight localities in northeast Delhi, many of whom suffered large-scale financial damages or were injured in the riots. Reuters also spoke with about 30 Muslims, most of whom said that Hindus had decided to stop working with them. Suman Goel, a 45-year-old housewife who has lived among Muslim neighbors for 23 years, said the violence had left her in a state of shock. \u201cIt\u2019s strange to lose a sense of belonging, to step out of your home and avoid smiling at Muslim women,\u201d she said. \u201cThey must be feeling the same too but it\u2019s best to maintain a distance.\u201d Mohammed Taslim, a Muslim who operated a business selling shoes from a shop owned by a Hindu in Bhajanpura, one of the neighborhoods affected by the riots, said his inventory was destroyed by a Hindu mob. He was then evicted and his space was leased out to a Hindu businessman, he said. \u201cThis is being done just because I am a Muslim,\u201d said Taslim. Many Muslims said the attack had been instigated by hardline Hindus to counter protests involving tens of thousands of people across India against the new citizenship law. \u201cThis is the new normal for us,\u201d said Adil, a Muslim research assistant with an economic think tank in central Delhi. \u201cCareers, jobs and business are no more a priority for us. Our priority now is to be safe and to protect our lives.\u201d  He declined to disclose his full name for fear of reprisals. Emboldened by Modi\u2019s landslide electoral victory in 2014, hardline groups began pursuing a Hindu-first agenda that has come at the expense of the country\u2019s Muslim minority. Vigilantes have attacked and killed a number of Muslims involved in transporting cows, which are seen as holy animals by Hindus, to slaughterhouses in recent years. The government has also adopted a tough stance with regard to Pakistan, and in August withdrew semi-autonomous privileges for Jammu and Kashmir, India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state. In November, the Supreme Court ruled that a Hindu temple could be built at Ayodhya, where a right-wing mob tore down a 16th-century mosque in 1992, a decision that was welcomed by the Modi government. The citizenship law, which eases the path for non-Muslims from neighboring Muslim-majority nations to gain citizenship in India, was the final straw for many Muslims, as well as secular Indians, sparking nationwide protests. Modi\u2019s office did not respond to questions from Reuters about the latest violence. During the day, Hindus and Muslims shun each other in the alleys of the Delhi districts that were hardest hit by the unrest in February. At night, when the threat of violence is greater, they are physically divided by barricades that are removed in the morning. And in some areas, permanent barriers are being erected. On a recent evening, Tarannum Sheikh, a schoolteacher, sat watching two welders install a high gate at the entrance of a narrow lane to the Muslim enclave of Khajuri Khas, where she lives. The aim was to keep Hindus out, she said. \u201cWe keep wooden batons with us to protect the entrance as at any time, someone can enter this alley to create trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not trust the police anymore.\u201d In the adjacent Hindu neighborhood of Bhajanpura, residents expressed a similar mistrust and sense of insecurity. \u201cIn a way these riots were needed to unite Hindus, we did not realize that we were surrounded by such evil minds for decades,\u201d said Santosh Rani, a 52-year-old grandmother.  She said she had been forced to lower her two grandchildren from the first floor of her house to the street below after the building was torched in the violence, allegedly by a Muslim. \u201cThis time the Muslims have tested our patience and now we will never give them jobs,\u201d said Rani who owns several factories and retail shops. \u201cI will never forgive them.\u201d Hasan Sheikh, a tailor who has stitched clothing for Hindu and Muslim women for over 40 years, said Hindu customers came to collect their unstitched clothes after the riots. \u201cIt was strange to see how our relationship ended,\u201d said Sheikh, who is Muslim. \u201cI was not at fault, nor were my women clients, but the social climate of this area is very tense.

The excise duties on the fuels, which have been hiked by 3 rupees per liter, is expected to result in up to 400 billion Indian rupees ($5.42 billion) increase in annual revenue, a senior government official told Reuters. Taxes on petrol and diesel, which account for more than a third of retail fuel prices, are one of the biggest sources of income for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government, which has more than tripled revenue from taxes on fuel since first coming to power in 2014. The excise duties on petrol and diesel contributed nearly 1,420.3 billion rupees ($19.24 billion), or nearly 11 percent of total tax revenue for the year ended March 2019. The move comes at a time when India is staring at the highest ever tax collection shortfall, as corporate and income tax collection for this fiscal year is set to fall for the first time in at least two decades and the goods and services tax revenue could see a gaping shortfall. Indian opposition parties have criticized the Modi government for their high fuel tax policy amid a decline in rural consumption, but economists have praised the move as fiscally prudent. \u201cThis balance by the government is a good strategy. This also helps the state shore up some revenue for other useful expenditures,\u201d said N.R. Bhanumurthy, economist at the government-backed National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi. India stopped controlling petrol prices in 2010 and diesel prices in 2014, linking them to global crude markets in a bid to ease pressure on government finances and improve the earnings of oil refiners.  Global oil prices posted their biggest week of losses since the 2008 global financial crisis, rocked by the coronavirus outbreak and efforts by top exporter Saudi Arabia and its allies to flood the market with record levels of supply.  The national hike translates to a 4.8% increase in diesel prices, and a 4.3% hike in petrol prices in India\u2019s capital New Delhi, compared with Friday\u2019s prices. Petrol was sold at 70 rupees a liter, while diesel was sold at 62.74 a liter on March 13.

An effective month-long ban on foreign tourist\u00a0visas\u00a0goes into force on Friday as the government seeks to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Travel restrictions make sense to prevent a big outbreak in a poor nation with a weak health\u00a0system, but\u00a0the move will\u00a0hurt a sector that contributes\u00a0around a tenth\u00a0of GDP in a slowing economy already reeling from financial blowups. New Delhi can soften the blow by allowing consumers to pocket the benefit of low crude prices.\u00a0 Cash handouts have gained popularity among policymakers as they try to prop up demand that has been crushed by measures implemented to slow the spread of the breakout, and by rising fear. Consumers, the logic goes, will spend\u00a0faster and more efficiently than governments.\u00a0Hong Kong and Australia have already announced direct cash payouts to residents.\u00a0 Luckily, cash-strapped India, the world\u2019s\u00a0third\u00a0largest importer of crude,\u00a0has an alternative: it\u00a0can\u00a0pass the 40% slump in oil prices over the past month along to the market.

Jay Prakash Ahirwar said his mother took his three children in 2015 to the local Child Welfare Committee (CWC), which protects vulnerable children, after his wife died - only to discover last month that a U.S. couple had adopted them. The CWC placed the children, then aged 3, 5 and 7, with the SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh state, where the charity runs a group foster home as part of its work to support 25,000 vulnerable children across India.  \u201cI wanted to take my children home for Holi festival last year, but (SOS Children\u2019s Villages officials) said they were getting good education and I should not spoil their lives. I thought maybe they were right,\u201d said Ahirwar.  \u201cWhen I went last month, I was told they were adopted by a U.S. family. They did not inform me or ask me. Did they give them away or did they sell them? I don\u2019t know,\u201d the 35-year-old autorickshaw driver said by phone from Bhopal. A spokesman for SOS Children\u2019s Villages said the charity told the government\u2019s child welfare department in 2016 not to put the children up for adoption as their father was alive. Ahirwar never visited his children and efforts to contact the family at their address and via newspaper adverts failed, the spokesman said, so in 2017 they were included in a list the charity gave the CWC of all the children in their facility. The CWC then declared the children as \u201clegally free\u201d for adoption as the newspaper adverts had elicited no response. \u201cThe adoption process was carried out on the directive of CWC and the specialized adoption agency,\u201d said Sudarshan Suchi, India director of SOS Children\u2019s Villages, a global charity supporting children without parental care and families at risk. About 80% of some 8 million children in orphanages globally or other institutions are not orphans, according to the charity Lumos, but they can be lucrative for trafficking networks, leading many \u201corigin\u201d countries to ban international adoptions. \u201cThese children were made \u2018legally free\u2019 in 2017. We are finding out if there was a criminal intent in doing so,\u201d said Tarun Kumar Pithode, district head of Bhopal. Some 2,500 children have been adopted overseas since 2015, according to the Central Adoption Resource Authority, which regulates adoptions. \u201cThis is a big racket. It validates our demand to stop inter-country adoptions,\u201d said Arun Dohle, director of Against Child Trafficking, a charity which has reunited dozens of inter-country adoptees with their birth mothers. India tightened up its adoption rules after cases emerged of parents being coerced or tricked to give up their children for inter-country adoptions. But the slow pace of the tightly-regulated process has fuelled baby trafficking, activists say.   Ahirwar is unsure whether he will see his children again.  \u201cThey have gone so far,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cIf they come back, it will be good. But if they don\u2019t, I just want to continue meeting them and talking to them.

The government of Uttar Pradesh in northern India put up six hoardings last week in prominent places in Lucknow, the state capital, identifying people it says joined in violent protests against a new citizenship law based on religion.    Allahabad High Court in Uttar Pradesh ordered the state government to remove the posters by March 16, saying they were \u201can unwarranted interference in [the] privacy of people\u201d. The state government, run by an ally of India\u2019s Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will comply with the court order but is considering its \u201clegal options\u201d, the chief minister\u2019s top adviser, Mrityunjay Kumar, said. The state government accuses the 57 people depicted in the posters of rioting in December, though none has been convicted of any crime. Those depicted accuse the authorities of trying to \u201cname and shame\u201d the protesters. Hundreds of thousands of people have held demonstrations across India since late last year to protest against the citizenship law, which they say discriminates against Muslims. Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party says the law is required to protect non-Muslim refugees across South Asia.  Criticizing the posters, Sadaf Jafar, the only woman to appear in them, told Reuters: \u201cThe action by the police and administration has made our lives more vulnerable. How will we feel secure in our city?\u201d  Jafar said she was considering taking legal action against the government. While it was not possible to verify the religion of those featured in the posters, the majority had names commonly used by India\u2019s minority Muslim population.   The actions of the government are \u201ctotally illegal\u201d, said S.R. Darapuri, a former police officer who also appeared on the billboards for supporting the protests. \u201cWe are not absconders or hardcore criminals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government by this act has put our lives in danger.\u201d The adviser, Kumar, has previously defended the billboards, saying they are an attempt to recover damages from those accused and insisting on their legality. India\u2019s demonstrations have spurred often-violent clashes between protesters and police, some along sectarian lines, in which more than 70 people have died, a majority in last month\u2019s bloodletting between Hindus and Muslims in the capital Delhi.

India\u2019s national land record modernization program seeks to re-survey lands, verify and upgrade records, and put the information online by 2021.  Authorities have said this will enable them to monitor land sales more easily, increase tax revenue and reduce corruption. But with some states not having surveyed their lands in more than a century, digitizing of existing records could be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d, said Namita Wahi, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, a think tank in New Delhi. In addition, there are data privacy issues with making land records easily accessible, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the sidelines of a land conference. \u201cTechnology has the potential to be empowering, but it is possible that it will empower those who are already empowered more than those who are currently disempowered,\u201d she said. Hundreds of laws and the lack of clear titles means that matters related to land and property make up about two-thirds of all civil cases in Indian courts, according to a study by Daksh, a legal advocacy group in Bengaluru. Population growth, industrial expansion and the need for more airports and roads, is putting greater pressure on land, with more than 700 disputes over land across India, according to Land Conflict Watch, a research organization. Digitization of land records is an important step toward greater transparency and efficiency, said Amy Coughenor, chief executive of Cadasta Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit that develops tools to document land. \u201cBut having digital records doesn\u2019t take away the need to accurately and fairly document land in the first place, ensuring equitable access to those who have been left out of land systems,\u201d she said. \u201cIssues of consent, fair access and gender equality must be part of a broader digitisation strategy. Otherwise these systems can further marginalise and disenfranchise people without digital access,\u201d she said. About 70% of land in the developing world is undocumented, leaving more than a quarter of the world\u2019s population vulnerable to conflict, evictions and encroachment, Cadasta estimates. With digitization comes an increased burden on such people to prove their ownership and safeguard their land, said Usha Ramanathan, an independent legal researcher who has studied India\u2019s digital identification system. \u201cFor the government, digitisation makes it easier to administer and go to market. But what is the use of an open registry for poor communities and small and marginalised farmers who cannot access it?\u201d she said. India also does not yet have a personal data protection law, and it is unclear who will control the data and who has access to it, she said. \u201cBringing in technology does not change the equation on the ground - people still have very differential access to technology,\u201d she said.

Last year, a viral video of Dalit men lowering a dead body by a rope from a bridge after an upper-caste community in the southern state of Tamil Nadu refused to allow the funeral procession to pass through their land, sparked a public uproar. In other states, Dalits sometimes have to keep their deceased relatives for several days until they can resolve where to bury or cremate them, said Lalit Babar, general secretary of the National Federation of Dalit Land Rights, an advocacy group. \u201cWe do not have land for housing or for livelihoods. Now, we are being denied land for dying,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have launched campaigns in several states to demand that our traditional burial grounds be returned, or new land be allotted,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the sidelines of a land conference in Delhi. India banned caste-based discrimination in 1955, but centuries-old biases against lower-caste groups, including Dalits persist, making it harder for them to access education, jobs and homes. More than half the country\u2019s lower-caste population is landless, census data showed. While several states have laws aimed at giving land to Dalits, few have done so, according to Dalit activists and leaders. Meanwhile, a growing population and rising pressure on land to build homes, highways, airports and industry is triggering conflicts, with farmers and lower-caste citizens most affected. In rural areas where caste biases are most entrenched, Dalits have lost their burial ground to village elites, Babar said. \u201cEven where we do have land, there are no facilities like water and electricity. Or we are not allowed to pass through the village with the body to go to the burial ground,\u201d he said. After a recent campaign by Dalit rights groups, authorities in the western state of Maharashtra have allocated small plots of land for cremation in villages with Dalit populations, he said. A broader national campaign by Dalit activists has long demanded for 5 acres (2 hectares) of land for each Dalit family - enough for a home and small farm to live off. Government officials in Tamil Nadu, in response to a court hearing after the viral video, said there was no discrimination against Dalits. But there is a long-standing battle in the state over so-called panchami land, which was allocated to Dalits during the British colonial era. Of an estimated 1.2 million acres (486,000 hectares) of land allotted, less than 10% is in the hands of Dalits, according to human rights groups. Without land of their own, Dalits are forced to cremate their dead along riverbanks or on public land, said Richard Devadoss, a convener for the South India Coalition for Land Rights, an advocacy group. \u201cWithout land, they have no power, no dignity, even in death,\u201d he said.

The Hindu-Muslim clashes in the city\u2019s northeast - the worst communal riots in Delhi for several decades - killed more than 40 people and injured hundreds. Thousands have been displaced after their homes were torched. Many of those uprooted were Muslims, while there were Hindus among the dead and injured. The capital city of more than 20 million people is likely to now see greater segmentation along religious lines as has happened in other Indian cities, such as Mumbai and Ahmedabad,  said Miloon Kothari, a housing and human rights expert. \u201cWe generally see greater ghettoisation in a city after a riot because of fear and insecurity, with city authorities themselves sometimes reorganising neighbourhoods that entrench that segregation,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cApartheid cities are being created due to political, planning and gentrification processes that divide communities further, impoverish the poor, and makes it easier to target vulnerable communities again.\u201d Displacements caused by flooding, beautification of cities, and major sporting events such as the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi and the 2016 Rio Olympics, also led to ghettoisation of the poor, said Kothari, a former United Nations special rapporteur for adequate housing. Delhi has long drawn migrants from neighboring states, who often live in informal settlements because of high rents. Like in other Indian cities, Delhi's informal rules and deep-rooted biases also discriminate here against religious minorities and even unmarried people, or those with certain food preferences or professions. Deadly communal clashes in Mumbai in 1992-93 and in the western city of Ahmedabad in 2002, led to Muslims being pushed out of mixed neighborhoods to the fringes of the city, said Darshani Mahadevia, a professor at Ahmedabad University. \u201cThe Muslim poor especially ... choose to live in all-Muslim neighbourhoods because they feel insecure,\u201d she said on the sidelines of a land conference in Delhi. \"Segregation keeps the communal pot boiling for political reasons also,\" she said, citing a law in the western state of Gujarat that restricts here Muslims and Hindus from selling property to each other in areas deemed as sensitive. Often, minority neighborhoods have poor infrastructure and inadequate housing, said Mahadevia, adding that residents also face difficulties securing bank loans and even taxi rides. The choice between living in a \"ghetto or mixed neighbourhood\" was a difficult one for many Muslims, writer and journalist Ghazala Wahab said on Twitter here this week. Families often had to weigh the risk of their home being torched against a better life, said Wahab, whose own family moved to a more modern \u201cHindu\u201d area from a ghetto - where conditions had since worsened. \u201cThat\u2019s not living, that\u2019s just existing,\u201d she said.

Now the 37-year-old Muslim mechanic is among more than 1,000 people sheltering in a large open-air mosque that has been turned into a relief camp in the Mustafabad area of the Indian capital and opened on Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t have any money left now,\u201d Anees said, showing pictures of his ransacked home that he visited on the weekend on his cracked mobile phone.  With jewelry and savings looted and afraid of more violence, he moved to the camp with his wife and three children, victims of the worst communal riots in New Delhi for decades. More than 40 people were killed and hundreds injured. Anees lived in Shiv Vihar, where two large mosques and dozens of Muslim houses surrounding it were torched. Houses with Hindu symbols were largely left untouched. In total, some 2,000 people are believed to have been displaced, local politician Amanatullah Khan said. Hundreds of those are taking shelter on the floors of private homes. \u201cThe police brought us and left us here,\u201d said Mohammed Uddin, 70, outside a cramped house where dozens of people packed into an entrance foyer. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even check if we were hurt.\u201d Many of those displaced, who are overwhelmingly Muslim, have moved to the Mustafabad camp, where a kitchen provides free meals and volunteer doctors are treating victims. Rashid Ali, a local resident helping organize the camp, said they had received some help from the Delhi government, run by a regional party. On a long desk outside the mosque premises, a small group of lawyers helped the victims of riots file for compensation ranging from 25,000 rupees ($341.34) to 100,000 rupees. Seema Joshi from Delhi\u2019s ruling Aam Aadmi Party, who was helping the legal team, said around 500 applications had been made, though many people showed up without any paperwork since they fled in a hurry without documents or had belongings burnt. In the narrow streets surrounding the mosque, women jostled for food supplies as children rummaged through piles of second-hand clothes donated to victims.

Another, who was aged 17 at the time, was released in 2015 after serving three years in a reform facility - the maximum term possible for a juvenile in India. The four hanged on Friday were gym instructor Vinay Sharma, bus cleaner Akshay  Thakur, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta and unemployed Mukesh Singh, who were all sentenced to death by a fast-track court in 2013.

She died in a hospital in Singapore, where she had been transferred in a desperate attempt to save her.   Outrage over her death led to India passing tough new laws against sexual violence, including the death penalty for rape in some cases.

Women reported almost 34,000 rapes in 2018, barely changed from the year before. Just over 85% led to charges, and 27% to convictions, according to the annual crime report released by the federal home ministry. Activists say the government statistics understate the number of rapes as it is still considered a taboo by conservative Indians to report sexual violence.

The telecom companies must pay billions in outstanding levies, penalties and interest following a 2019 Supreme Court order, putting industry giant Vodafone Idea - which owes some $4 billion - on the brink of collapse. Seeking to avoid such a disruptive outcome, the government this week petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the companies to pay the money over 20 years. But on Wednesday, the Save Consumer Rights Foundation said it opposed the government\u2019s move. \u201cNo other arrangement ought to be allowed apart from what the Court has passed as orders,\u201d Sriram Parakkat, the group\u2019s Supreme Court lawyer, told Reuters.  The top court is due to hear the matter again in two weeks. The foundation originally lodged a petition in January, arguing the government was in contempt of the court because it had instructed officials not to take coercive action against telecoms firms to demand payment. Vodafone Idea and rival Bharti Airtel have been discussing a flexible payment schedule with the government, according to several sources. Meanwhile, carrier Jio, backed by India\u2019s richest man Mukesh Ambani, has paid its roughly $27 million in dues. The Supreme Court heard the foundation\u2019s petition on Feb. 14, according to a court schedule, and Justice Arun Mishra then threatened officials with contempt proceedings, prompting the government at that time to demand \u201cimmediate\u201d payment.  Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel declined to comment.  The foundation was set up in 2018 by Anoop Nair, who has worked in banking in the Middle East and now runs his own risk assessment business in New Delhi.  Nair told Reuters it decided to act out of fear the government might be deprived of revenue.  \u201cWe had a meeting where we decided that this public money should not be thrown away,\u201d he said in an interview.  Nair said the foundation was exclusively funded by himself and a few other \u201ccore members,\u201d and otherwise relied on volunteers.

A municipal gardener in the capital of the northern Punjab state, Sharma has been protesting against the watches that city employees are being told to wear to track their efficiency, a move he called \u201chumiliating\u201d and \u201cunethical\u201d. \u201cI have worked for 25 years to keep this city beautiful and now they want to make me a bonded labourer and humiliate me,\u201d Sharma told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cBesides, we have supervisors who monitor our work and this tracking cannot be forced on us. It is unethical,\u201d he said in a phone interview. As India pushes ahead with its plan to turn 100 urban centres into smart cities, local governments are using technology like GPS watches to provide data they can use to improve efficiency and tighten budgets.  But city employees, campaigners and technology experts have raised concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of that data, as well as the susceptibility of the watches to failure like weak GPS signal or the devices switching off.  For three months Sharma and his colleagues from various departments like horticulture, sanitation and health have been gathering to demand that officials in Chandigarh, hailed as one of India\u2019s cleanest cities, stop using the GPS watches. They are among a growing number of municipal workers in a dozen cities across India who are protesting the linking of surveillance data to performance and salaries. Under the project, which launched in Chandigarh in February, workers are mandated to wear the GPS watches during their working hours. The watches feed a stream of data to a central control room, where officials monitor the movements of each employee.  If workers remove their watches, they are penalised, although there is no comprehensive data available on how many workers have been fined so far, or by how much. \u201cThe efficiency trackers seem like an over-reach,\u201d said Nandini Chami, deputy director at IT for Change, a Bangalore-based non-profit. \u201cGiven the nature of the employer-employee relationship, it is essential to know what are the boundaries of this surveillance and what will be a worker\u2019s right to appeal any data they want to contest,\u201d she said. Municipal commissioner K. K. Yadav, Chandigarh\u2019s top civic official, said in a phone interview that the programme is about improving efficiency.  \u201cThis is an efficient way to check if our workers are on the ground doing their jobs,\u201d added Yadav, who said he also wears a watch, to set an example.  \u201cTheir salaries will be linked to this tracker and all the data will be put in the public domain eventually for increasing accountability.\u201d Yadav noted that there is no expectation of privacy for government employees while they are at work and that complaints and appeals would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  Suresh Kumar Sharma has been driving a sewer-cleaning machine for over two decades, unclogging street drains throughout Chandigarh. He said he has raised questions with his supervisors and other senior officials as he tries to understand the need for GPS surveillance. \u201cSometimes we receive five complaints (of blocked drains) in a day, but are able to attend to only one because cleaning blocked drains takes time,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cThe GPS tracker is going to reflect that I was only at one place and did not attend to the other four complaints. It will indicate that I did not complete my job and that will reflect in a pay cut. How is that okay?\u201d  Sharma said officials have reassured workers that there will be a complaint mechanism in place, though no details were provided.  Despite concerns from rights groups and protests from workers, the efficiency tracker project has been rolled out across India since 2017.  The initiative has been praised by civic bodies aiming to both make their cities smarter and meet the goals of the Clean India campaign launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. \u201cIt is the need of the hour,\u201d said Sumedha Kataria, municipal commissioner for Panchkula city in Haryana state. About 950 city employees in Panchkula have been wearing the watches since the programme started there last year, said Kataria. \u201cThere are targets to be met for the Swachh Bharat (Clean India) mission. Also, if we are vying to be a smart city then digital intervention is important for us to achieve our targets. It is the smart thing to do,\u201d she said in a phone interview.  Without a comprehensive data privacy law in India, the personal information of the country\u2019s 1.3 billion citizens is openly available, with no regulation over its use or protection for its users, digital rights campaigners say.  The Personal Data Protection Bill, which is pending parliament approval, will create a framework for data protection dictating what kind of data can be collected, and how it is collected, processed and stored. The bill also introduces hefty penalties for the misuse of that data. But the draft bill has met with opposition from various groups, including human rights organisations, for not meeting global privacy standards. Chami at IT for Change noted that the GPS watches for municipal workers are constantly collecting potentially sensitive data, including personal information and behavioural patterns. \u201cWithout mechanisms to allow the worker to audit his or her tracker data ... and appeal (or) contest errors stemming from remote tracker malfunction, workers\u2019 rights will be squelched,\u201d she said.  Nagpur city, in the western state of Maharashtra, has had more than 7,000 workers under watch since 2017. Pradeep Dasarwar, the health officer in charge of the project in Nagpur, said that since the project started, absenteeism has dropped by half, from 15% to 7%, and that wages were being cut for contract workers. Around the city, areas have been virtually fenced off, with street names and localities that have been earmarked for each worker fed into their GPS watches, Dasarwar explained. Unlike before, when workers marked their own attendance at the start and end of the day, the GPS watch project tracks their whereabouts automatically, making a note each time they leave their designated work area, he said. The watches provide data on how many hours they spend at work, how many breaks they take, and the number of work orders they respond to. \u201cIn the cases where (workers) are not doing their job properly, salary cuts have been initiated and we have data to show for it,\u201d Dasarwar said, over the phone. But Sharma, the gardener, does not see the watches as the key to efficiency. To him, they are a digital tool to \u201cthreaten\u201d and exploit workers. \u201cAt the end of the day, we don\u2019t know how they will use this data. Wage cuts are just the beginning.\u201d  Reporting by Anuradha Nagaraj @AnuraNagaraj; Editing by Jumana Farouky and Zoe Tabary.

Global oil prices have fallen around 40% in March as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has destroyed demand, while supplies are growing following Moscow\u2019s refusal to back deeper output cuts at a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its OPEC+ allies.  Leading OPEC producers Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi have said they will increase output while cutting prices, giving big consumers the chance to fill up at discounted prices. \u201cIt is an opportune time for us and for them (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and Saudi Aramco) to finalize the deals and fill the SPRs...If there is any delay, we might fill the SPRs on our own,\u201d said an official familiar with the matter, asking not to be named. A second source, who also requested anonymity, said the oil ministry has written to the finance ministry to release about 48-to-50 billion rupees ($673.7 million) to buy oil in 8-9 very large crude carriers for filling the storage. Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL) and India\u2019s oil and finance ministry had no immediate comment, while ADNOC and Saudi Aramco declined to comment. India, the world\u2019s third biggest oil importer and consumer,  imports about 80% of its oil needs and has built strategic storage at three locations in southern India to store up to 36.87 million barrels of oil or about 5 million tonnes to protect against supply disruption. ISPRL, a company charged with building of strategic storage, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the UAE\u2019s national oil company ADNOC for the lease of half of its 2.5 million tonnes Padur facility.  Last year it signed an MoU with Saudi Aramco for the lease of a quarter of Padur SPR. The leases allow the national oil companies to store their oil, some of which will cater for India\u2019s strategic needs, while they can sell the rest to Indian refiners. Padur has four compartments that hold about 4.6 million barrels each. The ISPRL has received 1 VLCC with Arab Mix to fill one compartment and will get a second VLCC in April, a third source said. The ISPRL has already leased half of the 1.5 million tonnes capacity in Mangalore storage to ADNOC, which has stored about 5.5 million barrels of Das oil in the cavern, while ISPRL has retained the remainder. \u201cThis is the right time to fill the SPRs before prices start moving up,\u201d a third source said. India has also filled its 1.03 million tonnes Vizag facility with Basra oil from another OPEC producer Iraq. While India is primarily taking advantage of low prices as a consumer nation, U.S. President Donald Trump aimed to help U.S. energy producers struggling to cope with the price fall by announcing he would take advantage of low prices to fill up the nation\u2019s emergency reserve.

But the riots that raged through the district last month appear to have cleaved lasting divisions in the community, reflecting a nationwide trend as tensions over the Hindu nationalist agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi boil over. Many Hindus in Yamuna Vihar, a sprawl of residential blocks and shops dotted with mosques and Hindu temples, and in other riot-hit districts of northeast Delhi, say they are boycotting merchants and refusing to hire workers from the Muslim community. Muslims say they are scrambling to find jobs at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has heightened pressure on India\u2019s economy. \u201cI have decided to never work with Muslims,\u201d said Yash Dhingra, who has a shop selling paint and bathroom fittings in Yamuna Vihar. \u201cI have identified new workers, they are Hindus,\u201d he said, standing in a narrow lane that was the scene of violent clashes in the riots that erupted on Feb. 23.  The trigger for the riots, the worst sectarian violence in the Indian capital in decades, was a citizenship law introduced last year that critics say marginalizes India\u2019s Muslim minority. Police records show at least 53 people, mostly Muslims, were killed and more than 200 were injured. Dhingra said the unrest had forever changed Yamuna Vihar. Gutted homes with broken doors can be seen across the neighborhood; electricity cables melted in the fires dangle dangerously above alleys strewn with stones and bricks used as makeshift weapons in the riots.  Most Hindu residents in the district are now boycotting Muslim workers, affecting everyone from cooks and cleaners to mechanics and fruit sellers, he said. \u201cWe have proof to show that Muslims started the violence, and now they are blaming it on us,\u201d Dhingra said. \u201cThis is their pattern as they are criminal-minded people.\u201d Those views were widely echoed in interviews with 25 Hindus in eight localities in northeast Delhi, many of whom suffered large-scale financial damages or were injured in the riots. Reuters also spoke with about 30 Muslims, most of whom said that Hindus had decided to stop working with them. Suman Goel, a 45-year-old housewife who has lived among Muslim neighbors for 23 years, said the violence had left her in a state of shock. \u201cIt\u2019s strange to lose a sense of belonging, to step out of your home and avoid smiling at Muslim women,\u201d she said. \u201cThey must be feeling the same too but it\u2019s best to maintain a distance.\u201d Mohammed Taslim, a Muslim who operated a business selling shoes from a shop owned by a Hindu in Bhajanpura, one of the neighborhoods affected by the riots, said his inventory was destroyed by a Hindu mob. He was then evicted and his space was leased out to a Hindu businessman, he said. \u201cThis is being done just because I am a Muslim,\u201d said Taslim. Many Muslims said the attack had been instigated by hardline Hindus to counter protests involving tens of thousands of people across India against the new citizenship law. \u201cThis is the new normal for us,\u201d said Adil, a Muslim research assistant with an economic think tank in central Delhi. \u201cCareers, jobs and business are no more a priority for us. Our priority now is to be safe and to protect our lives.\u201d  He declined to disclose his full name for fear of reprisals. Emboldened by Modi\u2019s landslide electoral victory in 2014, hardline groups began pursuing a Hindu-first agenda that has come at the expense of the country\u2019s Muslim minority. Vigilantes have attacked and killed a number of Muslims involved in transporting cows, which are seen as holy animals by Hindus, to slaughterhouses in recent years. The government has also adopted a tough stance with regard to Pakistan, and in August withdrew semi-autonomous privileges for Jammu and Kashmir, India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state. In November, the Supreme Court ruled that a Hindu temple could be built at Ayodhya, where a right-wing mob tore down a 16th-century mosque in 1992, a decision that was welcomed by the Modi government. The citizenship law, which eases the path for non-Muslims from neighboring Muslim-majority nations to gain citizenship in India, was the final straw for many Muslims, as well as secular Indians, sparking nationwide protests. Modi\u2019s office did not respond to questions from Reuters about the latest violence. During the day, Hindus and Muslims shun each other in the alleys of the Delhi districts that were hardest hit by the unrest in February. At night, when the threat of violence is greater, they are physically divided by barricades that are removed in the morning. And in some areas, permanent barriers are being erected. On a recent evening, Tarannum Sheikh, a schoolteacher, sat watching two welders install a high gate at the entrance of a narrow lane to the Muslim enclave of Khajuri Khas, where she lives. The aim was to keep Hindus out, she said. \u201cWe keep wooden batons with us to protect the entrance as at any time, someone can enter this alley to create trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not trust the police anymore.\u201d In the adjacent Hindu neighborhood of Bhajanpura, residents expressed a similar mistrust and sense of insecurity. \u201cIn a way these riots were needed to unite Hindus, we did not realize that we were surrounded by such evil minds for decades,\u201d said Santosh Rani, a 52-year-old grandmother.  She said she had been forced to lower her two grandchildren from the first floor of her house to the street below after the building was torched in the violence, allegedly by a Muslim. \u201cThis time the Muslims have tested our patience and now we will never give them jobs,\u201d said Rani who owns several factories and retail shops. \u201cI will never forgive them.\u201d Hasan Sheikh, a tailor who has stitched clothing for Hindu and Muslim women for over 40 years, said Hindu customers came to collect their unstitched clothes after the riots. \u201cIt was strange to see how our relationship ended,\u201d said Sheikh, who is Muslim. \u201cI was not at fault, nor were my women clients, but the social climate of this area is very tense.

The excise duties on the fuels, which have been hiked by 3 rupees per liter, is expected to result in up to 400 billion Indian rupees ($5.42 billion) increase in annual revenue, a senior government official told Reuters. Taxes on petrol and diesel, which account for more than a third of retail fuel prices, are one of the biggest sources of income for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government, which has more than tripled revenue from taxes on fuel since first coming to power in 2014. The excise duties on petrol and diesel contributed nearly 1,420.3 billion rupees ($19.24 billion), or nearly 11 percent of total tax revenue for the year ended March 2019. The move comes at a time when India is staring at the highest ever tax collection shortfall, as corporate and income tax collection for this fiscal year is set to fall for the first time in at least two decades and the goods and services tax revenue could see a gaping shortfall. Indian opposition parties have criticized the Modi government for their high fuel tax policy amid a decline in rural consumption, but economists have praised the move as fiscally prudent. \u201cThis balance by the government is a good strategy. This also helps the state shore up some revenue for other useful expenditures,\u201d said N.R. Bhanumurthy, economist at the government-backed National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi. India stopped controlling petrol prices in 2010 and diesel prices in 2014, linking them to global crude markets in a bid to ease pressure on government finances and improve the earnings of oil refiners.  Global oil prices posted their biggest week of losses since the 2008 global financial crisis, rocked by the coronavirus outbreak and efforts by top exporter Saudi Arabia and its allies to flood the market with record levels of supply.  The national hike translates to a 4.8% increase in diesel prices, and a 4.3% hike in petrol prices in India\u2019s capital New Delhi, compared with Friday\u2019s prices. Petrol was sold at 70 rupees a liter, while diesel was sold at 62.74 a liter on March 13.

An effective month-long ban on foreign tourist\u00a0visas\u00a0goes into force on Friday as the government seeks to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Travel restrictions make sense to prevent a big outbreak in a poor nation with a weak health\u00a0system, but\u00a0the move will\u00a0hurt a sector that contributes\u00a0around a tenth\u00a0of GDP in a slowing economy already reeling from financial blowups. New Delhi can soften the blow by allowing consumers to pocket the benefit of low crude prices.\u00a0 Cash handouts have gained popularity among policymakers as they try to prop up demand that has been crushed by measures implemented to slow the spread of the breakout, and by rising fear. Consumers, the logic goes, will spend\u00a0faster and more efficiently than governments.\u00a0Hong Kong and Australia have already announced direct cash payouts to residents.\u00a0 Luckily, cash-strapped India, the world\u2019s\u00a0third\u00a0largest importer of crude,\u00a0has an alternative: it\u00a0can\u00a0pass the 40% slump in oil prices over the past month along to the market. That would be a far more efficient way to stimulate the economy than, say, cutting incomes taxes in a country where so few pay\u00a0them.\u00a0Economic growth slipped to 4.5% in the September quarter, but Citi analysts note that every 10% decline in oil pushes Indian GDP up 15 basis points. Diesel prices were deregulated in 2014 as global energy costs fell;\u00a0petrol\u00a0was liberalised\u00a0even earlier.\u00a0But Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government\u00a0has largely\u00a0retained those savings for itself by\u00a0ramping\u00a0up\u00a0taxes. Duties now account for about half of retail fuel prices. Officials will once again be tempted to keep the gains given New Delhi\u2019s shortfall of tax revenues.

Jay Prakash Ahirwar said his mother took his three children in 2015 to the local Child Welfare Committee (CWC), which protects vulnerable children, after his wife died - only to discover last month that a U.S. couple had adopted them. The CWC placed the children, then aged 3, 5 and 7, with the SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh state, where the charity runs a group foster home as part of its work to support 25,000 vulnerable children across India.  \u201cI wanted to take my children home for Holi festival last year, but (SOS Children\u2019s Villages officials) said they were getting good education and I should not spoil their lives. I thought maybe they were right,\u201d said Ahirwar.  \u201cWhen I went last month, I was told they were adopted by a U.S. family. They did not inform me or ask me. Did they give them away or did they sell them? I don\u2019t know,\u201d the 35-year-old autorickshaw driver said by phone from Bhopal. A spokesman for SOS Children\u2019s Villages said the charity told the government\u2019s child welfare department in 2016 not to put the children up for adoption as their father was alive. Ahirwar never visited his children and efforts to contact the family at their address and via newspaper adverts failed, the spokesman said, so in 2017 they were included in a list the charity gave the CWC of all the children in their facility. The CWC then declared the children as \u201clegally free\u201d for adoption as the newspaper adverts had elicited no response. \u201cThe adoption process was carried out on the directive of CWC and the specialized adoption agency,\u201d said Sudarshan Suchi, India director of SOS Children\u2019s Villages, a global charity supporting children without parental care and families at risk. About 80% of some 8 million children in orphanages globally or other institutions are not orphans, according to the charity Lumos, but they can be lucrative for trafficking networks, leading many \u201corigin\u201d countries to ban international adoptions. \u201cThese children were made \u2018legally free\u2019 in 2017. We are finding out if there was a criminal intent in doing so,\u201d said Tarun Kumar Pithode, district head of Bhopal. Some 2,500 children have been adopted overseas since 2015, according to the Central Adoption Resource Authority, which regulates adoptions. \u201cThis is a big racket. It validates our demand to stop inter-country adoptions,\u201d said Arun Dohle, director of Against Child Trafficking, a charity which has reunited dozens of inter-country adoptees with their birth mothers. India tightened up its adoption rules after cases emerged of parents being coerced or tricked to give up their children for inter-country adoptions. But the slow pace of the tightly-regulated process has fuelled baby trafficking, activists say.   Ahirwar is unsure whether he will see his children again.  \u201cThey have gone so far,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cIf they come back, it will be good. But if they don\u2019t, I just want to continue meeting them and talking to them.

The government of Uttar Pradesh in northern India put up six hoardings last week in prominent places in Lucknow, the state capital, identifying people it says joined in violent protests against a new citizenship law based on religion.    Allahabad High Court in Uttar Pradesh ordered the state government to remove the posters by March 16, saying they were \u201can unwarranted interference in [the] privacy of people\u201d. The state government, run by an ally of India\u2019s Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will comply with the court order but is considering its \u201clegal options\u201d, the chief minister\u2019s top adviser, Mrityunjay Kumar, said. The state government accuses the 57 people depicted in the posters of rioting in December, though none has been convicted of any crime. Those depicted accuse the authorities of trying to \u201cname and shame\u201d the protesters. Hundreds of thousands of people have held demonstrations across India since late last year to protest against the citizenship law, which they say discriminates against Muslims. Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party says the law is required to protect non-Muslim refugees across South Asia.  Criticizing the posters, Sadaf Jafar, the only woman to appear in them, told Reuters: \u201cThe action by the police and administration has made our lives more vulnerable. How will we feel secure in our city?\u201d  Jafar said she was considering taking legal action against the government. While it was not possible to verify the religion of those featured in the posters, the majority had names commonly used by India\u2019s minority Muslim population.   The actions of the government are \u201ctotally illegal\u201d, said S.R. Darapuri, a former police officer who also appeared on the billboards for supporting the protests. \u201cWe are not absconders or hardcore criminals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government by this act has put our lives in danger.\u201d The adviser, Kumar, has previously defended the billboards, saying they are an attempt to recover damages from those accused and insisting on their legality. India\u2019s demonstrations have spurred often-violent clashes between protesters and police, some along sectarian lines, in which more than 70 people have died, a majority in last month\u2019s bloodletting between Hindus and Muslims in the capital Delhi.

India\u2019s national land record modernization program seeks to re-survey lands, verify and upgrade records, and put the information online by 2021.  Authorities have said this will enable them to monitor land sales more easily, increase tax revenue and reduce corruption. But with some states not having surveyed their lands in more than a century, digitizing of existing records could be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d, said Namita Wahi, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, a think tank in New Delhi. In addition, there are data privacy issues with making land records easily accessible, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the sidelines of a land conference. \u201cTechnology has the potential to be empowering, but it is possible that it will empower those who are already empowered more than those who are currently disempowered,\u201d she said. Hundreds of laws and the lack of clear titles means that matters related to land and property make up about two-thirds of all civil cases in Indian courts, according to a study by Daksh, a legal advocacy group in Bengaluru. Population growth, industrial expansion and the need for more airports and roads, is putting greater pressure on land, with more than 700 disputes over land across India, according to Land Conflict Watch, a research organization. Digitization of land records is an important step toward greater transparency and efficiency, said Amy Coughenor, chief executive of Cadasta Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit that develops tools to document land. \u201cBut having digital records doesn\u2019t take away the need to accurately and fairly document land in the first place, ensuring equitable access to those who have been left out of land systems,\u201d she said. \u201cIssues of consent, fair access and gender equality must be part of a broader digitisation strategy. Otherwise these systems can further marginalise and disenfranchise people without digital access,\u201d she said. About 70% of land in the developing world is undocumented, leaving more than a quarter of the world\u2019s population vulnerable to conflict, evictions and encroachment, Cadasta estimates. With digitization comes an increased burden on such people to prove their ownership and safeguard their land, said Usha Ramanathan, an independent legal researcher who has studied India\u2019s digital identification system. \u201cFor the government, digitisation makes it easier to administer and go to market. But what is the use of an open registry for poor communities and small and marginalised farmers who cannot access it?\u201d she said. India also does not yet have a personal data protection law, and it is unclear who will control the data and who has access to it, she said. \u201cBringing in technology does not change the equation on the ground - people still have very differential access to technology,\u201d she said.

Last year, a viral video of Dalit men lowering a dead body by a rope from a bridge after an upper-caste community in the southern state of Tamil Nadu refused to allow the funeral procession to pass through their land, sparked a public uproar. In other states, Dalits sometimes have to keep their deceased relatives for several days until they can resolve where to bury or cremate them, said Lalit Babar, general secretary of the National Federation of Dalit Land Rights, an advocacy group. \u201cWe do not have land for housing or for livelihoods. Now, we are being denied land for dying,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have launched campaigns in several states to demand that our traditional burial grounds be returned, or new land be allotted,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the sidelines of a land conference in Delhi. India banned caste-based discrimination in 1955, but centuries-old biases against lower-caste groups, including Dalits persist, making it harder for them to access education, jobs and homes. More than half the country\u2019s lower-caste population is landless, census data showed. While several states have laws aimed at giving land to Dalits, few have done so, according to Dalit activists and leaders. Meanwhile, a growing population and rising pressure on land to build homes, highways, airports and industry is triggering conflicts, with farmers and lower-caste citizens most affected. In rural areas where caste biases are most entrenched, Dalits have lost their burial ground to village elites, Babar said. \u201cEven where we do have land, there are no facilities like water and electricity. Or we are not allowed to pass through the village with the body to go to the burial ground,\u201d he said. After a recent campaign by Dalit rights groups, authorities in the western state of Maharashtra have allocated small plots of land for cremation in villages with Dalit populations, he said. A broader national campaign by Dalit activists has long demanded for 5 acres (2 hectares) of land for each Dalit family - enough for a home and small farm to live off. Government officials in Tamil Nadu, in response to a court hearing after the viral video, said there was no discrimination against Dalits. But there is a long-standing battle in the state over so-called panchami land, which was allocated to Dalits during the British colonial era. Of an estimated 1.2 million acres (486,000 hectares) of land allotted, less than 10% is in the hands of Dalits, according to human rights groups. Without land of their own, Dalits are forced to cremate their dead along riverbanks or on public land, said Richard Devadoss, a convener for the South India Coalition for Land Rights, an advocacy group. \u201cWithout land, they have no power, no dignity, even in death,\u201d he said.

The Hindu-Muslim clashes in the city\u2019s northeast - the worst communal riots in Delhi for several decades - killed more than 40 people and injured hundreds. Thousands have been displaced after their homes were torched. Many of those uprooted were Muslims, while there were Hindus among the dead and injured. The capital city of more than 20 million people is likely to now see greater segmentation along religious lines as has happened in other Indian cities, such as Mumbai and Ahmedabad,  said Miloon Kothari, a housing and human rights expert. \u201cWe generally see greater ghettoisation in a city after a riot because of fear and insecurity, with city authorities themselves sometimes reorganising neighbourhoods that entrench that segregation,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cApartheid cities are being created due to political, planning and gentrification processes that divide communities further, impoverish the poor, and makes it easier to target vulnerable communities again.\u201d Displacements caused by flooding, beautification of cities, and major sporting events such as the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi and the 2016 Rio Olympics, also led to ghettoisation of the poor, said Kothari, a former United Nations special rapporteur for adequate housing. Delhi has long drawn migrants from neighboring states, who often live in informal settlements because of high rents. Like in other Indian cities, Delhi's informal rules and deep-rooted biases also discriminate here against religious minorities and even unmarried people, or those with certain food preferences or professions. Deadly communal clashes in Mumbai in 1992-93 and in the western city of Ahmedabad in 2002, led to Muslims being pushed out of mixed neighborhoods to the fringes of the city, said Darshani Mahadevia, a professor at Ahmedabad University. \u201cThe Muslim poor especially ... choose to live in all-Muslim neighbourhoods because they feel insecure,\u201d she said on the sidelines of a land conference in Delhi. \"Segregation keeps the communal pot boiling for political reasons also,\" she said, citing a law in the western state of Gujarat that restricts here Muslims and Hindus from selling property to each other in areas deemed as sensitive. Often, minority neighborhoods have poor infrastructure and inadequate housing, said Mahadevia, adding that residents also face difficulties securing bank loans and even taxi rides. The choice between living in a \"ghetto or mixed neighbourhood\" was a difficult one for many Muslims, writer and journalist Ghazala Wahab said on Twitter here this week. Families often had to weigh the risk of their home being torched against a better life, said Wahab, whose own family moved to a more modern \u201cHindu\u201d area from a ghetto - where conditions had since worsened. \u201cThat\u2019s not living, that\u2019s just existing,\u201d she said.

With jewelry and savings looted and afraid of more violence, he moved to the camp with his wife and three children, victims of the worst communal riots in New Delhi for decades. More than 40 people were killed and hundreds injured. Anees lived in Shiv Vihar, where two large mosques and dozens of Muslim houses surrounding it were torched. Houses with Hindu symbols were largely left untouched. In total, some 2,000 people are believed to have been displaced, local politician Amanatullah Khan said. Hundreds of those are taking shelter on the floors of private homes. \u201cThe police brought us and left us here,\u201d said Mohammed Uddin, 70, outside a cramped house where dozens of people packed into an entrance foyer. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even check if we were hurt.\u201d Many of those displaced, who are overwhelmingly Muslim, have moved to the Mustafabad camp, where a kitchen provides free meals and volunteer doctors are treating victims.

On a long desk outside the mosque premises, a small group of lawyers helped the victims of riots file for compensation ranging from 25,000 rupees ($341.34) to 100,000 rupees. Seema Joshi from Delhi\u2019s ruling Aam Aadmi Party, who was helping the legal team, said around 500 applications had been made, though many people showed up without any paperwork since they fled in a hurry without documents or had belongings burnt. In the narrow streets surrounding the mosque, women jostled for food supplies as children rummaged through piles of second-hand clothes donated to victims. On a loudspeaker, an announcer asked for volunteers to clean an overflowing toilet attached to the relief camp.  \u201cA lot of people are facing depression,\u201d said Wasim Qamar, a doctor at the camp. \u201cPeople saw terrible things. Some of them can\u2019t eat or sleep. They are very fearful.\u201d Describing the violence as \u201cone-sided and well-planned\u201d against Muslims, the Delhi Minorities Commission - a government-appointed body that focuses on minority groups - said the Delhi government\u2019s compensation package was inadequate after surveying riot-hit areas on Tuesday. Saurabh Bharadwaj, a lawmaker from Aam Aadmi, said the party was trying to improve its response to the emergency. Some leaders from Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party have accused opposition groups of fanning the violence, saying that Muslims targeted Hindus during the clashes. Shabira, 55, and her family were rescued by police early last Wednesday from Shiv Vihar, leaving their home with nothing but what they were wearing. At the relief camp, she said she was getting basic amenities - food, shelter and diapers for her infant grandchild. \u201cI want my house back,\u201d she said, in tears. \u201cI just want to go back.\u201d Reporting by Alasdair Pal and Devjyot Ghoshal, additional reporting by Anushree Fadnavis; editing by Mike Collett-White", "date_posted": "2020-03-21T21:34:18.154Z", "image": ""}},
